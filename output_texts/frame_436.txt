216. A company hosts an application on Amazon EC2 that is subject to specific rules for regulatory
compliance. One rule states that traffic to and from the workload must be inspected for network-level
attacks. This involves inspecting the whole packet.

To comply with this regulatory rule, a security engineer must install intrusion detection software on a
c5n.4xlarge EC2 instance. The engineer must then configure the software to monitor traffic to and
from the application instances.

What should the security engineer do next?
A. Place the network interface in promiscuous mode to capture the traffic.

B. Configure VPC Flow Logs to send traffic to the monitoring EC2 instance using a Network Load
Balancer.

C. Configure VPC traffic mirroring to send traffic to the monitoring EC2 instance using a Network Load
Balancer.

D. Use Amazon Inspector to detect network-level attacks and trigger an AWS Lambda function to send
the suspicious packets to the EC2 instance.

Answer: C
