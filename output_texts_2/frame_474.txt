444) A security engineer is designing a cloud architecture to support an application. The application runs on Amazon EC2
instances and processes sensitive information, including credit card numbers.

The application will send the credit card numbers to a component that is running in an isolated environment. The component
will encrypt, store, and decrypt the numbers. The component then will issue tokens to replace the numbers in other parts of
the application.

The component of the application that manages the tokenization process will be deployed on a separate set of EC2
instances. Other components of the application must not be able to store or access the credit card numbers.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Use EC2 Dedicated Instances for the tokenization component of the application.

B. Place the EC2 instances that manage the tokenization process into a partition placement group.

C. Create a separate VPDeploy new EC2 instances into the separate VPC to support the data tokenization.
D. Deploy the tokenization code onto AWS Nitro Enclaves that are hosted on EC2 instances.

Answer: D
