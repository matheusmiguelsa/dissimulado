412) A security team is using Amazon EC2 Image Builder to build a hardened AMI with forensic capabilities. An AWS Key
Management Service (AWS KMS) key will encrypt the forensic AMI. EC2 Image Builder successfully installs the required
patches and packages in the security teamâ€™s AWS account. The security team uses a federated IAM role in the same AWS
account to sign in to the AWS Management Console and attempts to launch the forensic AMI. The EC2 instance launches
and immediately terminates.

What should the security team do to launch the EC2 instance successfully?

A. Update the policy that is associated with the federated IAM role to allow the ec2:Describelmages action for the
forensic AML.

B. Update the policy that is associated with the federated IAM role to allow the ec2:StartInstances action in the
security team's AWS account.

C. Update the policy that is associated with the KMS key that is used to encrypt the forensic AMI. Configure the
policy to allow the kms:Encrypt and kms:Decrypt actions for the federated IAM role.

D. Update the policy that is associated with the federated IAM role to allow the kms:DescribeKey action for the
KMS key that is used to encrypt the forensic AMI.
