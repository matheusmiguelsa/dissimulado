286) A company Is planning to use Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) with its on-premises servers. The company has
an existing IAM Direct Connect connection established between its on-premises data center and an IAM Region Security policy
states that the company's on-premises firewall should only have specific IP addresses added to the allow list and not a CIDR
range. The company also wants to restrict access so that only certain data center-based servers have access to Amazon EFS

How should a security engineer implement this solution"

A.Add the file-system-id efs |AM-region amazonlAM com URL to the allow list for the data center firewall Install the [AM
CLI on the data center-based servers to mount the EFS file system in the EFS security group add the data center IP range
to the allow list Mount the EFS using the EFS file system name.

B.Assign an Elastic IP address to Amazon EFS and add the Elastic IP address to the allow list for the data center firewall
Install the IAM CLI on the data center-based servers to mount the EFS file system In the EFS security group, add the IP
addresses of the data center servers to the allow list Mount the EFS using the Elastic IP address.

C.Add the EFS file system mount target IP addresses to the allow list for the data center firewall In the EFS security
group, add the data center server IP addresses to the allow list Use the Linux terminal to mount the EFS file system using
the IP address of one of the mount targets.

D.Assign a static range of IP addresses for the EFS file system by contacting [AM Support In the EFS security group add
the data center server IP addresses to the allow list Use the Linux terminal to mount the EFS file system using one of the
static IP addresses.
