61. An organization wants to be alerted when an unauthorized Amazon EC2 instance in its VPC
performs a network port scan against other instances in the VPC.

When the Security team performs its own internal tests in a separate account by using pre-approved
third-party scanners from the AWS Marketplace, the Security team also then receives multiple Amazon
GuardDuty events from Amazon CloudWatch alerting on its test activities.

How can the Security team suppress alerts about authorized security tests while still receiving alerts
about the unauthorized activity?

A. Use a filter in AWS CloudTrail to exclude the IP addresses of the Security team's EC2 instances.

B. Add the Elastic IP addresses of the Security team's EC2 instances to a trusted IP list in Amazon
GuardDuty.

C. Install the Amazon Inspector agent on the EC2 instances that the Security team uses.

D. Grant the Security team's EC2 instances a role with permissions to call Amazon GuardDuty API
operations.

Answer: B
