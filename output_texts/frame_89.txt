43. A Software Engineer is trying to figure out why network connectivity to an Amazon EC2 instance
does not appear to be working correctly. Its security group allows inbound HTTP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0,
and the outbound rules have not been modified from the default. A custom network ACL associated
with its subnet allows inbound HTTP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 and has no outbound rules.

What would resolve the connectivity issue?

A. The outbound rules on the security group do not allow the response to be sent to the client on the
ephemeral port range.

B. The outbound rules on the security group do not allow the response to be sent to the client on the
HTTP port.

C. An outbound rule must be added to the network ACL to allow the response to be sent to the client on
the ephemeral port range.

D. An outbound rule must be added to the network ACL to allow the response to be sent to the client on
the HTTP port.

Answer: C
