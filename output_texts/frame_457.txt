226. A company has two software development teams that are creating applications that store sensitive
data in Amazon $3. Each team's data must always be separate. The company's security team must design a
data encryption strategy for both teams that provides the ability to audit key usage. The solution must also
minimize operational overhead.

What should the security team recommend?

A. Tell the application teams to use two different S3 buckets with separate AWS Key Management Service
(AWS KMS) AWS managed CMkKs. Limit the key policies to allow encryption and decryption of the CMKs to
their respective teams only. Force the teams to use encryption context to encrypt and decrypt.

B. Tell the application teams to use two different S3 buckets with a single AWS Key Management Service
(AWS KMS) AWS managed CMK. Limit the key policy to allow encryption and decryption of the CMK only. Do
not allow the teams to use encryption context to encrypt and decrypt.

C. Tell the application teams to use two different S3 buckets with separate AWS Key Management Service
(AWS KMS) customer managed CMks. Limit the key policies to allow encryption and decryption of the CMKs
to their respective teams only. Force the teams to use encryption context to encrypt and decrypt.

D. Tell the application teams to use two different S3 buckets with a single AWS Key Management Service
(AWS KMS) customer managed CMK. Limit the key policy to allow encryption and decryption of the CMK
only. Do not allow the teams to use encryption context to encrypt and decrypt.
