320) A company's application team wants to replace an internal application with a new IAM architecture that consists of
Amazon EC2 instances, an IAM Lambda function, and an Amazon S3 bucket in a single [AM Region. After an architecture
review, the security team mandates that no application network traffic can traverse the public internet at any point. The
security team already has an SCP in place for the company's organization in IAM Organizations to restrict the creation of
internet gateways. NAT gateways, and egress-only gateways.

Which combination of steps should the application team take to meet these requirements? (Select THREE.)

B.Create an S3 access point for the $3 bucket. Include a policy that restricts the network origin to VPCs.
C.Launch the Lambda function. Enable the block public access configuration.

D.Create a security group that has an outbound rule over port 443 with a destination of the $3 endpomt.
Associate the security group with the EC2 instances.
