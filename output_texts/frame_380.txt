188. A company wants to deploy a distributed web application on a fleet of EC2 instances. The fleet
will be fronted by a Classic Load Balancer that will be configured to terminate the TLS connection. The
company wants to make sure that all past and current TLS traffic to the Classic Load Balancer stays

Balancer with:

A. An HTTPS listener that uses a certificate that is managed by Amazon Certification Manager.

suites.

C. An HTTPS listener that uses the latest AWS predefined ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS-1-2-2017-01 security
policy.

D. A TCP listener that uses a custom security policy that allows only perfect forward secrecy cipher
suites.
