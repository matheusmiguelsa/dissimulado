managed encryption keys (SSE-S3) to encrypt the key Create a resigned URL tor the S3 key. and specify the URL ma
Lambda environmental variable in the [AM CloudFormation template Update the Lambda function code to retrieve the
key using the URL and call the API

C.Create a secret in IAM Secrets Manager in the security account to store the API key using IAM Key Management
Service (IAM KMS) tor encryption Grant access to the IAM role used by the Lambda function so that the function can
retrieve the key from Secrets Manager and call the API
