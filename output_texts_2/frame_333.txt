383) A security engineer is investigating a malware infection that has spread across a set of Amazon EC2 instances. A key
indicator of the compromise is outbound traffic on TCP port 2905 to a set of command and control hosts on the internet.
The security engineer creates a network ACL rule that denies the identified outbound traffic. The security engineer applies
the network ACL rule to the subnet of the EC2 instances. The security engineer must identify any EC2 instances that are
trying to communtcate on TCP port 2905.

Which solution will identify the affected EC2 instances with the LEAST operational effort?

A. Create a firewall in AWS Network Firewall. Attach the firewall to the subnet of the EC2 instances. Create a
custom rule to identify and log traffic from the firewall on TCP port 2905. Create an Amazon CloudWatch Logs
metric filter to identify firewall logs that reference traffic on TCP port 2905.

B. Create a Network Access Scope in Amazon VPC Network Access Analyzer. Use the Network Access Scope
to identify EC2 instances that try to send traffic to TCP port 2905.

C. Enable VPC flow logs for the VPC where the affected EC2 instances are located Configure the flow logs to
capture rejected traffic. In the flow logs, search for REJECT records that have a destination TCP port of 2905.
D. Enable Amazon GuardDuty Create a custom GuardDuty IP list to create a finding when an EC2 instance tries
to communicate with one of the command and control hosts. Use Amazon Detective to identify the EC2
instances that initiate the communication.

Correct Answer: C
