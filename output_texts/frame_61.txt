29. During a recent security audit, it was discovered that multiple teams in a large organization have
placed restricted data in multiple Amazon $3 buckets, and the data may have been exposed. The
auditor has requested that the organization identify all possible objects that contain personally
identifiable information (PII) and then determine whether this information has been accessed.

What solution will allow the Security team to complete this request?

A. Using Amazon Athena, query the impacted S3 buckets by using the Pll query identifier function.
Then, create a new Amazon CloudWatch metric for Amazon $3 object access to alert when the objects
are accessed.

B. Enable Amazon Macie on the $3 buckets that were impacted, then perform data classification. For
identified objects that contain Pll, use the research function for auditing AWS CloudTrail logs and S3
bucket logs for GET operations. Most Voted

C. Enable Amazon GuardDuty and enable the Pll rule set on the S3 buckets that were impacted, then
perform data classification. Using the PII findings report from GuardDuty, query the S3 bucket logs by
using Athena for GET operations.

D. Enable Amazon Inspector on the $3 buckets that were impacted, then perform data classification.
For identified objects that contain Pll, query the $3 bucket logs by using Athena for GET operations.
