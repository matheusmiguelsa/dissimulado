213. A city is implementing an election results reporting website that will use Amazon CloudFront. The
website runs on a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances behind an

Application Load Balancer (ALB) in an Auto Scaling group. Election results are updated hourly and are
stored as .pdf files in an Amazon $3 bucket. A security engineer needs to ensure that all external
access to the website goes through CloudFront.

Which solution meets these requirements?

A. Create an IAM role that allows CloudFront to access the specific $3 bucket. Modify the $3 bucket
policy to allow only the new IAM role to access its contents. Create an interface VPC endpoint for
CloudFront to securely communicate with the ALB.

B. Create an IAM role that allows CloudFront to access the specific $3 bucket. Modify the $3 bucket
policy to allow only the new IAM role to access its contents. Associate the ALB with a security group
that allows only incoming traffic from the CloudFront service to communicate with the ALB.

C. Create an origin access identity (OAl) in CloudFront. Modify the $3 bucket policy to allow only the
new OAI to access the bucket contents. Create an interface VPC endpoint for CloudFront to securely
communicate with the ALB.

D. Create an origin access identity (OAl) in CloudFront. Modify the $3 bucket policy to allow only the
new OAI to access the bucket contents. Associate the ALB with a security group that allows only
incoming traffic from the CloudFront service to communicate with the ALB.
