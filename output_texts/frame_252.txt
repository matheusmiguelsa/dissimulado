124. A Security Engineer for a large company is managing a data processing application used by 1,500
subsidiary companies. The parent and subsidiary companies all use AWS. The application uses TCP port 443
and runs on Amazon EC2 behind a Network Load Balancer (NLB). For compliance reasons, the application
should only be accessible to the subsidiaries and should not be available on the public internet. To meet the
compliance requirements for restricted access, the Engineer has received the public and private CIDR block
ranges for each subsidiary.

What solution should the Engineer use to implement the appropriate access restrictions for the application?

A. Create a NACL to allow access on TCP port 443 from the 1,500 subsidiary CIDR block ranges. Associate
the NACL to both the NLB and EC2 instances

B. Create an AWS security group to allow access on TCP port 443 from the 1,500 subsidiary CIDR block
ranges. Associate the security group to the NLB. Create a second security group for EC2 instances with
access on TCP port 443 from the NLB security group.

C. Create an AWS PrivateLink endpoint service in the parent company account attached to the NLB. Create
an AWS security group for the instances to allow access on TCP port 443 from the AWS PrivateLink
endpoint. Use AWS PrivateLink interface endpoints in the 1,500 subsidiary AWS accounts to connect to the
data processing application.

D. Create an AWS security group to allow access on TCP port 443 from the 1,500 subsidiary CIDR block
ranges. Associate the security group with EC2 instances.

Answer: C
