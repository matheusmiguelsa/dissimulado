10. A company will store sensitive documents in three Amazon $3 buckets based on a data
classification scheme of “Sensitive, “Confidential, and “Restricted. The security solution must meet
all of the following requirements:

c® Each object must be encrypted using a unique key.

c® Items that are stored in the Restricted’ bucket require two-factor authentication for decryption.
ce AWS KMS must automatically rotate encryption keys annually.

Which of the following meets these requirements?

A. Create a Customer Master Key (CMK) for each data classification type, and enable the rotation of it
annually. For the €aRestricted€ aCMK, define the MFA policy within the key policy. Use S3 SSE-KMS to
encrypt the objects.

B. Create a CMK grant for each data classification type with EnableKeyRotation and
MultiFactorAuthPresent set to true. S3 can then use the grants to encrypt each object with a unique
CMK.

C. Create a CMK for each data classification type, and within the CMK policy, enable rotation of it
annually, and define the MFA policy. S3 can then create DEK grants to uniquely encrypt each object
within the $3 bucket.

D. Create a CMK with unique imported key material for each data classification type, and rotate them
annually. For the €aRestricted€ akey material, define the MFA policy in the key policy. Use S3 SSE-KMS
to encrypt the objects.
