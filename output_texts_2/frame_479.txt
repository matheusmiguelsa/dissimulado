446) A security engineer is configuring account-based access control (ABAC) to allow only specific principals to put
objects into an Amazon S3 bucket. The principals already have access to Amazon S3.

The security engineer needs to configure a bucket policy that allows principals to put objects into the $3 bucket only if the
value of the Team tag on the object matches the value of the Team tag that is associated with the principal. During testing,
the security engineer notices that a principal can still put objects into the $3 bucket when the tag values do not match.

Which combination of factors are causing the PutObject operation to succeed when the tag values are different? (Choose
two.)

A. The principal's identity-based policy grants access to put objects into the S3 bucket with no conditions.
B. The principal's identity-based policy overrides the condition because the identity-based policy contains an
explicit allow.

C. The $3 bucket's resource policy does not deny access to put objects.

D. The $3 bucket's resource policy cannot allow actions to the principal.

E. The bucket policy does not apply to principals in the same zone of trust.
