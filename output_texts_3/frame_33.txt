A multinational company is developing a sophisticated web application that requires integration with multiple third-party APIs. The companyâ€™s unique keys for each API are hardcoded inside an AWS CloudFormation template.

The security team requires that the keys be passed into the template without exposing their values in plaintext. Moreover, the keys must be encrypted at rest and in transit.

Which of the following provides the HIGHEST level of security while meeting these requirements?

A. Use AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store to store the API keys. Then, reference them in the AWS CloudFormation templates using !GetAtt AppKey.Value
B. Use AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store to store the API keys as SecureString parameters. Then, reference them in the AWS CloudFormation templates using {{resolve:ssm:AppKey}}
C. Utilize AWS Secrets Manager to store the API keys. Then, reference them in the AWS CloudFormation templates using {{resolve:secretsmanager:AppKey:SecretString:password}}
D. Use an Amazon S3 bucket to store the API keys. Then, create a custom AWS Lambda function to read the keys from the S3 bucket. Reference the keys in the AWS CloudFormation templates using a custom resource that invokes the Lambda function.
Answer: C
