129. A company has enabled Amazon GuardDulty in all Regions as part of its security monitoring
strategy. In one of the VPCs, the company hosts an Amazon EC2 instance working as an FTP server
that is contacted by a high number of clients from multiple locations. This is identified by GuardDuty as
a brute force attack due to the high number of connections that happen every hour.

The finding has been flagged as a false positive. However, GuardDuty keeps raising the issue. A
Security Engineer has been asked to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The Engineer needs to ensure
that changes co not compromise the visibility of potential anomalous behavior.

B. Add the FTP server to a trusted IP list and deploy it to GuardDuty to stop receiving the notifications
C. Use GuardDuty filters with auto archiving enabled to close the findings
