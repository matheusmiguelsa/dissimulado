373) An international company has established a new business entity in South Kore a. The company also has established a
new AWS account to contain the workload for the South Korean region. The company has set up the workload in the new
account in the ap-northeast-2 Region. The workload consists of three Auto Scaling groups of Amazon EC2 instances. All
workloads that operate in this Region must keep system logs and application logs for 7 years.

activities. The solution also must keep the logs for only the required period of 7 years.

C. Configure an Amazon S3 Lifecycle policy on the target S3 bucket to expire objects after 7 years.

D. Attach an IAM role to the launch configuration or launch template that the Auto Scaling groups use. Configure the role
to provide the necessary permissions to forward logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

E. Ensure that the Amazon CloudWatch agent is installed on all the EC2 instances that the Auto Scaling groups launch.
Generate a CloudWatch agent configuration file to forward the required logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.
