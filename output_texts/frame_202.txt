99. An application uses Amazon Cognito to manage end users’ permissions when directly accessing
AWS resources, including Amazon DynamoDB. A new feature request reads as follows:

Provide a mechanism to mark customers as suspended pending investigation or suspended
permanently. Customers should still be able to log in when suspended, but should not be able to make
changes.

The priorities are to reduce complexity and avoid potential for future security issues.
Which approach will meet these requirements and priorities?

A. Create a new database field €asuspended_status€ aand modify the application logic to validate that
field when processing requests.

B. Add suspended customers to second Cognito user pool and update the application login flow to
check both user pools.

C. Use Amazon Cognito Sync to push out a €asuspension_status€ aparameter and split the IAM policy
into normal users and suspended users.

D. Move suspended customers to a second Cognito group and define an appropriate IAM access policy
for the group.

Answer: D
