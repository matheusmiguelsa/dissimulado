457) A security engineer needs to run an AWS CloudFormation script. The CloudFormation script builds AWS infrastructure
to support a stack that includes web servers and a MySQL database. The stack has been deployed in pre-production
environments and is ready for production.

The production script must comply with the principle of least privilege. Additionally, separation of duties must exist
between the security engineerâ€™s IAM account and CloudFormation.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Use IAM Access Analyzer policy generation to generate a policy that allows the CloudFormation script to run and
manage the stack. Attach the policy to a new IAM role. Modify the security engineer's [AM permissions to be able to
pass the new role to CloudFormation.

B. Create an IAM policy that allows ec2:* and rds:* permissions. Attach the policy to a new IAM role. Modify the
security engineer's IAM permissions to be able to assume the new role.

C. Use IAM Access Analyzer policy generation to generate a policy that allows the CloudFormation script to run and
manage the stack. Modify the security engineer's [AM permissions to be able to run the CloudFormation script.

D. Create an IAM policy that allows ec2:* and rds:* permissions. Attach the policy to a new IAM role. Use the [AM
policy simulator to confirm that the policy allows the AWS API calls that are necessary to build the stack. Modify the
security engineer's [AM permissions to be able to pass the new role to CloudFormation.
