397) A company uses infrastructure as code (laC) to create AWS infrastructure. The company writes the code as AWS
CloudFormation templates to deploy the infrastructure. The company has an existing CI/CD pipeline that the company can
use to deploy these templates.

After a recent security audit, the company decides to adopt a policy-as-code approach to improve the company's security
posture on AWS. The company must prevent the deployment of any infrastructure that would violate a security policy, such
as an unencrypted Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Turn on AWS Trusted Advisor. Configure security notifications as webhooks in the preferences section of the
CI/CD pipeline.

B. Turn on AWS Config. Use the prebuilt rules or customized rules. Subscribe tile Cl/CD pipeline to an Amazon
Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic that receives notifications from AWS Config.

C. Create rule sets in AWS CloudFormation Guard. Run validation checks for CloudFormation templates as a
phase of the CI/CD process.

D. Create rule sets as SCPs. Integrate the SCPs as a part of validation control in a phase of the CI/CD process.
