359) A security engineer wants to evaluate configuration changes to a specific AWS resource to ensure that the resource
meets compliance standards. However, the security engineer is concerned about a situation in which several configuration
changes are made to the resource in quick succession. The security engineer wants to record only the latest configuration of
that resource to indicate the cumulative impact of the set of changes.

Which solution will meet this requirement in the MOST operationally efficient way?

A. Use AWS Config to detect the configuration changes and to record the latest configuration in case of
multiple configuration changes.

B. Use AWS CloudTrail to detect the configuration changes by filtering API calls to monitor the changes. Use
the most recent API call to indicate the cumulative impact of multiple calls

C. Use AWS Cloud Map to detect the configuration changes. Generate a report of configuration changes from
AWS Cloud Map to track the latest state by using a sliding time window.

D. Use Amazon CloudWatch to detect the configuration changes by filtering API calls to monitor the changes.
Use the most recent API call to indicate the cumulative impact of multiple calls.

Correct Answer: A
