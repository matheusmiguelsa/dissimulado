152. A Development team has built an experimental environment to test a simple static web application. It
has built an isolated VPC with a private and a public subnet.

The public subnet holds only an Application Load Balancer, a NAT gateway, and an internet gateway. The
private subnet holds all of the Amazon EC2 instances.

There are 3 different types of servers. Each server type has its own Security Group that limits access to only
required connectivity. The Security Groups have both inbound and outbound rules applied. Each subnet has
both inbound and outbound network ACLs applied to limit access to only required connectivity.

Which of the following should the team check if a server cannot establish an outbound connection to the
internet? (Choose three.)

A. The route tables and the outbound rules on the appropriate private subnet security group.

B. phe outbound network ACL rules on the private subnet and the inbound network ACL rules on the public
subnet.

C. The outbound network ACL rules on the private subnet and both the inbound and outbound rules on the
public subnet.

D. The rules on any host-based firewall that may be applied on the Amazon EC2 instances.
E. The Security Group applied to the Application Load Balancer and NAT gateway.

F. that the 0.0.0.0/0 route in the private subnet route table points to the Internet gateway in the public
subnet.
