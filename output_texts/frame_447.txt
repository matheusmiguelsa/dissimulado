221. A company is running an application on Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group. The
application stores logs locally. A security engineer noticed that logs were lost after a scale-in event. The
security engineer needs to recommend a solution to ensure the durability and availability of log data. All logs
must be kept for a minimum of 1 year for auditing purposes.

What should the security engineer recommend?

A. Within the Auto Scaling lifecycle, add a hook to create an attach an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon
EBS) log volume each time an EC2 instance is created. When the instance is terminated, the EBS volume can
be reattached to another instance for log review.

B. Create an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system and add a command in the user data
section of the Auto Scaling launch template to mount the EFS file system during EC2 instance creation.
Configure a process on the instance to copy the logs once a day from an instance Amazon Elastic Block
Store (Amazon EBS) volume to a directory in the EFS file system.

C. Build the Amazon CloudWatch agent into the AMI used in the Auto Scaling group. Configure the
CloudWatch agent to send the logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs for review.

D. Within the Auto Scaling lifecycle, add a lifecycle hook at the terminating state transition and alert the
engineering team by using a lifecycle notification to Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS).
Configure the hook to remain in the Terminating:Wait state for 1 hour to allow manual review of the security
logs prior to instance termination.
