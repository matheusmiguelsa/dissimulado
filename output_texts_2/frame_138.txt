294) A company's on-premises networks are connected to VPCs using an IAM Direct Connect gateway. The company's on-
premises application needs to stream data using an existing Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream. The
company's security policy requires that data be encrypted in transit using a private network.

How should the company meet these requirements?

A.Create a VPC endpoint tor Kinesis Data Firehose. Configure the application to connect to the VPC endpoint.
B.Configure an IAM policy to restrict access to Kinesis Data Firehose using a source IP condition.

Configure the application to connect to the existing Firehose delivery stream.

C.Create a new TLS certificate in IAM Certificate Manager (ACM). Create a public-facing Network Load Balancer (NLB)
and select the newly created TLS certificate. Configure the NLB to forward all traffic to Kinesis Data Firehose. Configure
the application to connect to the NLB.

D.Peer the on-premises network with the Kinesis Data Firehose VPC using Direct Connect. Configure the application to
connect to the existing Firehose delivery stream.
