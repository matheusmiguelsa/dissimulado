367) A company has an organization in AWS Organizations that includes dedicated accounts for each of its business units.
The company is collecting all AWS CloudTrail logs from the accounts in a single Amazon S3 bucket in the top-level
account. The company's IT governance team has access to the top-level account. A security engineer needs to allow each
business unit to access its own CloudTrail logs.

The security engineer creates an IAM role in the top-level account for each of the other accounts. For each role the
security engineer creates an IAM policy to allow read-only permissions to objects in the S3 bucket with the prefix of the
respective logs.

Which action must the security engineer take in each business unit account to allow an IAM user in that account to read
the logs?

A. Create an SCP that grants permissions to the top-level account.

B. Forward the credentials of the IAM role in the top-level account to the IAM user in the business
unit account.

C. Attach a policy to the IAM user to allow the user to assume the role that was created in the top-
level account. Specify the role's ARN in the policy.

D. Use the root account of the business unit account to assume the role that was created in the top-
level account. Specify the role's ARN in the policy.

Correct Answer: C
