24. The Security Engineer is managing a web application that processes highly sensitive personal
information. The application runs on Amazon EC2. The application has strict compliance requirements,

Which architecture should the Security Engineer use to meet these requirements?

A. Use AWS Shield to scan inbound traffic for web exploits. Use VPC Flow Logs and AWS Lambda to
restrict egress traffic to specific whitelisted URLs.

B. Use AWS Shield to scan inbound traffic for web exploits. Use a third-party AWS Marketplace solution
to restrict egress traffic to specific whitelisted URLs.

C. Use AWS WAF to scan inbound traffic for web exploits. Use VPC Flow Logs and AWS Lambda to
restrict egress traffic to specific whitelisted URLs.

D. Use AWS WAF to scan inbound traffic for web exploits. Use a third-party AWS Marketplace solution
to restrict egress traffic to specific whitelisted URLs.
