431) A company in France uses Amazon Cognito with the Cognito Hosted UI as an identity broker for sign-in and sign-up
processes. The company is marketing an application and expects that all the application's users will come from France.

When the company launches the application, the company's security team observes fraudulent sign-ups for the
application. Most of the fraudulent registrations are from users outside of France.

The security team needs a solution to perform custom validation at sign-up. Based on the results of the validation, the
solution must accept or deny the registration request.

Which combination of steps will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

A. Create a pre sign-up AWS Lambda trigger. Associate the Amazon Cognito function with the Amazon Cognito user
pool.

B. Use a geographic match rule statement to configure an AWS WAF web ACL. Associate the web ACL with the
Amazon Cognito user pool.

C. Configure an app client for the application's Amazon Cognito user pool. Use the app client ID to validate the
requests in the hosted UI.

D. Update the application's Amazon Cognito user pool to configure a geographic restriction setting.
E. Use Amazon Cognito to configure a social identity provider (IdP) to validate the requests on the hosted UI.
