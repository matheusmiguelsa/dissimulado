366) A company has a group of Amazon EC2 instances in a single private subnet of a VPC with no internet gateway attached. A
security engineer has installed the Amazon CloudWatch agent on all instances in that subnet to capture logs from a specific
application. To ensure that the logs flow securely, the company's networking team has created VPC endpoints for CloudWatch
monitoring and CloudWatch logs. The networking team has attached the endpoints to the VPC.

The application is generating logs. However, when the security engineer queries CloudWatch, the logs do not appear.

Which combination of steps should the security engineer take to troubleshoot this issue? (Choose three.)

A. Create a metric filter on the logs so that they can be viewed in the AWS Management Console.

B. Ensure that the EC2 instance profile that is attached to the EC2 instances has permissions to create log streams and
write logs.

C. Check the VPC endpoint policies of both VPC endpoints to ensure that the EC2 instances have permissions to use
them.

D. Check the CloudWatch agent configuration file on each EC2 instance to make sure that the CloudWatch agent is
collecting the proper log files.

E. Create a NAT gateway in the subnet so that the EC2 instances can communicate with CloudWatch.

F. Ensure that the security groups allow all the EC2 instances to communicate with each other to aggregate logs before
sending.
