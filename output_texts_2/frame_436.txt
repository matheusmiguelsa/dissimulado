428) A security engineer has designed a VPC to segment private traffic from public traffic. The VPC includes two
Availability Zones. The security engineer has provisioned each Availability Zone with one private subnet and one public
subnet. The security engineer has created three route tables for use with the environment. One route table is for the
public subnets, and two route tables are for the private subnets (one route table for the private subnet in each
Availability Zone).

The security engineer discovers that all four subnets are attempting to route traffic out through the internet gateway
that is attached to the VPC.

Which combination of steps should the security engineer take to remediate this scenario? (Select TWO.)

A. Verify that a NAT gateway has been provisioned in the public subnet in each Availability Zone.

B. Verify that a NAT gateway has been provisioned in the private subnet in each Availability Zone.

C. Modify the route tables that are associated with each of the public subnets. Create a new route for local destinations to the VPC
CIDR range.

D. Modify the route tables that are associated with each of the private subnets Create a new route for the destination 0.0.0.070.
Specify the NAT gateway in the public subnet of the same Availability Zone as the target of the route.

E. Modify the route tables that are associated with each of the private subnets. Create a new route for the destination 0.0.0.0/0.
Specify the internet gateway in the public subnet of the same Availability Zone as the target of the route.

Answer: A, D
