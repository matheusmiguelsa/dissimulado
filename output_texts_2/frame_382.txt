404) A company has two AWS accounts. One account is for development workloads. The other account is for production
workloads. For compliance reasons the production account contains all the AWS Key Management. Service (AWS KMS) keys
that the company uses for encryption.

The company applies an IAM role to an AWS Lambda function in the development account to allow secure access to AWS
resources. The Lambda function must access a specific KMS customer managed key that exists in the production account to
encrypt the Lambda function's data.

Which combination of steps should a security engineer take to meet these requirements? (Select TWO.)

A. Configure the key policy for the customer managed key in the production account to allow access to the Lambda service.

B. Configure the key policy for the customer managed key in the production account to allow access to the IAM role of the Lambda
function in the development account.

C. Configure a new IAM policy in the production account with permissions to use the customer managed key. Apply the IAM policy to
the IAM role that the Lambda function in the development account uses.

D. Configure a new key policy in the development account with permissions to use the customer managed key. Apply the key policy to
the IAM role that the Lambda function in the development account uses.

E. Configure the IAM role for the Lambda function in the development account by attaching an IAM policy that allows access to the
customer managed key in the production account.
