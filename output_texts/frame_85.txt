41. An application outputs logs to a text file. The logs must be continuously monitored for security
incidents.

Which design will meet the requirements with MINIMUM effort?

A. Create a scheduled process to copy the component's logs into Amazon $3. Use S3 events to trigger
a Lambda function that updates Amazon CloudWatch metrics with the log data. Set up CloudWatch
alerts based on the metrics.

B. Install and configure the Amazon CloudWatch Logs agent on the application's EC2 instance. Create
a CloudWatch metric filter to monitor the application logs. Set up CloudWatch alerts based on the
metrics.

C. Create a scheduled process to copy the application log files to AWS CloudTrail. Use $3 events to
trigger Lambda functions that update CloudWatch metrics with the log data. Set up CloudWatch alerts
based on the metrics.

D. Create a file watcher that copies data to Amazon Kinesis when the application writes to the log file.
Have Kinesis trigger a Lambda function to update Amazon CloudWatch metrics with the log data. Set
up CloudWatch alerts based on the metrics.
