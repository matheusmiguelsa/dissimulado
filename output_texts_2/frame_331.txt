382) An IAM user receives an Access Denied message when the user attempts to access objects in an Amazon $3 bucket.
The user and the $3 bucket are in the same AWS account. The S3 bucket is configured to use server-side encryption with
AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS) to encrypt all of its objects at rest by using a customer managed key from the same AWS
account. The $3 bucket has no bucket policy defined. The IAM user has been granted permissions through an IAM policy
that allows the kms:Decrypt permission to the customer managed key. The IAM policy also allows the s3:List* and s3:Get*
permissions for the $3 bucket and its objects.

Which of the following is a possible reason that the IAM user cannot access the objects in the $3 bucket?

A. The KMS key policy has been edited to remove the ability for the AWS account to have full access to the
key.

B. The IAM policy needs to allow the kms:DescribeKey permission.

C. An S3 bucket policy needs to be added to allow the IAM user to access the objects.

D. The S3 bucket has been changed to use the AWS managed key to encrypt objects at rest.

Correct Answer: A
