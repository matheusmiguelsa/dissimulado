218. A company wants to encrypt data locally while meeting regulatory requirements related to key
exhaustion. The encryption key can be no more than 10 days old or encrypt more than 2°16 objects.
Any encryption key must be generated on a FIPS-validated hardware security module (HSM). The
company Is cost-conscious, as it plans to upload an average of 100 objects to Amazon S3 each second
for sustained operations across 5 data producers.

Which approach MOST efficiently meets the company's needs?

A. Use the AWS Encryption SDK and set the maximum age to 10 days and the maximum number of
messages encrypted to 2"16. Use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to generate the master
key and data key. Use data key caching with the Encryption SDK during the encryption process.

B. Use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to generate an AWS managed CMK. Then use
Amazon S3 client-side encryption configured to automatically rotate with every object.

C. Use AWS CloudHSM to generate the master key and data keys. Then use Boto 3 and Python to
locally encrypt data before uploading the object. Rotate the data key every 10 days or after 2°16
objects have been uploaded to Amazon S3.

D. Use server-side encryption with Amazon $3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3) and set the master
key to automatically rotate.
