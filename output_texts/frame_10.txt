4.A Security Administrator is restricting the capabilities of company root user accounts. The
company uses AWS Organizations and has enabled it for all feature sets, including
consolidated billing. The top-level account is used for billing and administrative purposes, not
for operational AWS resource purposes.

How can the Administrator restrict usage of member root user accounts across the
organization?

A. Disable the use of the root user account at the organizational root. Enable multi-factor
authentication of the root user account for each organizational member account.

B. Configure IAM user policies to restrict root account capabilities for each Organizations
member account.

C. Create an organizational unit (OU) in Organizations with a service control policy that
controls usage of the root user. Add all operational accounts to the new OU.

D. Configure AWS CloudTrail to integrate with Amazon CloudWatch Logs and then create a
metric filter for RootAccountUsage.
