211. A company is designing the security architecture for a global latency-sensitive web application it plans to
deploy to AWS. A security engineer needs to configure a highly available and secure two-tier architecture. The
security design must include controls to prevent common attacks such as DDoS, cross-site scripting, and

SQL injection.

Which solution meets these requirements?

A. Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB) that uses public subnets across multiple Availability Zones within a
single Region. Point the ALB to an Auto Scaling group with Amazon EC2 instances in private subnets across
multiple Availability Zones within the same Region. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution that uses the ALB
as its origin. Create appropriate AWS WAF ACLs and enable them on the CloudFront distribution.

B. Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB) that uses private subnets across multiple Availability Zones within a
single Region. Point the ALB to an Auto Scaling group with Amazon EC2 instances in private subnets across
multiple Availability Zones within the same Region. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution that uses the ALB
as its origin. Create appropriate AWS WAF ACLs and enable them on the CloudFront distribution.

C. Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB) that uses public subnets across multiple Availability Zones within a
single Region. Point the ALB to an Auto Scaling group with Amazon EC2 instances in private subnets across
multiple Availability Zones within the same Region. Create appropriate AWS WAF ACLs and enable them on the
ALB.

D. Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB) that uses private subnets across multiple Availability Zones within a
single Region. Point the ALB to an Auto Scaling group with Amazon EC2 instances in private subnets across
multiple Availability Zones within the same Region. Create appropriate AWS WAF ACLs and enable them on the
ALB.
