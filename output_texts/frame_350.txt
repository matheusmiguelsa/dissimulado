173. A company uses HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) to stream live video content to paying subscribers by
using Amazon CloudFront. HLS splits the video content into chunks so that the user can request the
right chunk based on different conditions. Because the video events last for several hours, the total
video is made up of thousands of chunks.

The origin URL is not disclosed, and every user is forced to access the CloudFront URL. The company
has a web application that authenticates the paying users against an internal repository and a
CloudFront key pair that is already issued.

What is the simplest and MOST effective way to protect the content?

A. Develop the application to use the CloudFront key pair to create signed URLs that users will use to
access the content.

B. Develop the application to use the CloudFront key pair to set the signed cookies that users will use
to access the content.

C. Develop the application to issue a security token that Lambda@Edge will receive to authenticate and
authorize access to the content.

D. Keep the CloudFront URL encrypted inside the application, and use AWS KMS to resolve the URL on-
the-fly after the user is authenticated.

Answer: B
