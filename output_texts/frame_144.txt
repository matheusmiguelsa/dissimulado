70. In response to the past DDoS attack experiences, a Security Engineer has set up an Amazon
CloudFront distribution for an Amazon $3 bucket. There is concern that some users may bypass the
CloudFront distribution and access the $3 bucket directly.

What must be done to prevent users from accessing the $3 objects directly by using URLs?
A. Change the S3 bucket/object permission so that only the bucket owner has access.

B. Set up a CloudFront origin access identity (OAl), and change the $3 bucket/object permission so
that only the OAI has access.

C. Create IAM roles for CloudFront, and change the $3 bucket/object permission so that only the IAM
role has access.

D. Redirect S3 bucket access to the corresponding CloudFront distribution.

Answer: B
