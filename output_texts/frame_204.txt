100. A company stores data on an Amazon EBS volume attached to an Amazon EC2 instance. The data
is asynchronously replicated to an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the EBS volume and the $3 bucket are
encrypted with the same AWS KMS Customer Master Key (CMK). A former employee scheduled a
deletion of that CMK before leaving the company.

The company's Developer Operations department learns about this only after the CMK has been
deleted.

Which steps must be taken to address this situation?

A. Copy the data directly from the EBS encrypted volume before the volume is detached from the EC2
instance.

B. Recover the data from the EBS encrypted volume using an earlier version of the KMS backing key.
C. Make a request to AWS Support to recover the S3 encrypted data.
D. Make a request to AWS Support to restore the deleted CMK, and use it to recover the data.
