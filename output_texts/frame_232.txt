114. A Security Engineer is building a Java application that is running on Amazon EC2. The application
communicates with an Amazon RDS instance and authenticates with a user name and password.

Which combination of steps can the Engineer take to protect the credentials and minimize downtime
when the credentials are rotated? (Choose two.)

A. Have a Database Administrator encrypt the credentials and store the ciphertext in Amazon S3. Grant
permission to the instance role associated with the EC2 instance to read the object and decrypt the
ciphertext.

B. Configure a scheduled job that updates the credential in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store
and notifies the Engineer that the application needs to be restarted.

C. Configure automatic rotation of credentials in AWS Secrets Manager.

D. Store the credential in an encrypted string parameter in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store.
Grant permission to the instance role associated with the EC2 instance to access the parameter and
the AWS KMS key that is used to encrypt it.

E. Configure the Java application to catch a connection failure and make a call to AWS Secrets
Manager to retrieve updated credentials when the password is rotated. Grant permission to the
instance role associated with the EC2 instance to access Secrets Manager.
