161. A company recently performed an annual security assessment of its AWS environment. The
assessment showed the audit logs are not available beyond 90 days and that unauthorized changes to

after 90 days. Configure Amazon Inspector to provide a notification when a policy change is made to
resources.

B. Configure AWS Artifact to archive AWS CloudTrail logs. Configure AWS Trusted Advisor to provide a
notification when a policy change is made to resources.

C. Configure Amazon CloudWatch to export log groups to Amazon S3. Configure AWS CloudTrail to
provide a notification when a policy change is made to resources.

D. Create an AWS CloudTrail trail that stores audit logs in Amazon $3. Configure an AWS Config rule to
provide a notification when a policy change is made to resources.
