395) A company recently had a security audit in which the auditors identified multiple potential threats. These potential
threats can cause usage pattern changes such as DNS access peak, abnormal instance traffic, abnormal network interface
traffic, and unusual Amazon S3 API calls. The threats can come from different sources and can occur at any time. The
company needs to implement a solution to continuously monitor its system and identify all these incoming threats in near-
real time.

A. Enable AWS CloudTrail logs, VPC flow logs, and DNS logs. Use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to manage these logs
from a centralized account.

B. Enable AWS CloudTrail logs, VPC flow logs, and DNS logs. Use Amazon Macie to monitor these logs from a
centralized account.

C. Enable Amazon GuardDuty from a centralized account. Use GuardDuty to manage AWS CloudTrail logs, VPC
flow logs, and DNS logs.

D. Enable Amazon Inspector from a centralized account. Use Amazon Inspector to manage AWS CloudTrail logs,
VPC flow logs, and DNS logs.
