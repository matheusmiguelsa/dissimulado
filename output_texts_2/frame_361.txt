394) A security engineer is configuring a mechanism to send an alert when three or more failed sign-in attempts to the
AWS Management Console occur during a 5-minute period. The security engineer creates a trail in AWS CloudTrail to
assist in this work.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. In CloudTrail, turn on Insights events on the trail. Configure an alarm on the insight with eventName matching
ConsoleLogin and errorMessage matching “Failed authentication”. Configure a threshold of 3 and a period of 5 minutes.
B. Configure CloudTrail to send events to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Create a metric filter for the relevant log group.
Create a filter pattern with eventName matching ConsoleLogin and errorMessage matching “Failed authentication”.
Create a CloudWatch alarm with a threshold of 3 and a period of 5 minutes.

C. Create an Amazon Athena table from the CloudTrail events. Run a query for eventName matching ConsoleLogin and
for errorMessage matching “Failed authentication”. Create a notification action from the query to send an Amazon
Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notification when the count equals 3 within a period of 5 minutes.

D. In AWS Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer, create a new analyzer. Configure the analyzer to send an
Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notification when a failed sign-in event occurs 3 times for any IAM
user within a period of 5 minutes.
