420) A company has created a set of AWS Lambda functions to automate incident response steps for incidents that occur on
Amazon EC2 instances. The Lambda functions need to collect relevant artifacts, such as instance ID and security group
configuration. The Lambda functions must then write a summary to an Amazon S3 bucket.

The company runs its workloads in a VPC that uses public subnets and private subnets. The public subnets use an internet
gateway to access the internet. The private subnets use a NAT gateway to access the internet.

All network traffic to Amazon S3 that is related to the incident response process must use the AWS network. This traffic must
not travel across the internet.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Deploy the Lambda functions to a private subnet in the VPC. Configure the Lambda functions to access the S3 service
through the NAT gateway.

B. Deploy the Lambda functions to a private subnet in the VPC. Create an S3 gateway endpoint to access the S3 service.
C. Deploy the $3 bucket and the Lambda functions in the same private subnet. Configure the Lambda functions to use the
default endpoint for the S3 service.

D. Deploy an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SOS) queue and the Lambda functions in the same private subnet.
Configure the Lambda functions to send data to the SQS queue. Configure the SOS queue to send data to the S3 bucket.

Correct Answer: B
