50. A Security Engineer has been asked to troubleshoot inbound connectivity to a web server. This single web

server is not receiving inbound connections from the internet, whereas all other web servers are functioning
roperly.

The architecture includes network ACLs, security groups, and a virtual security appliance. In addition, the

Development team has implemented Application Load

Which of the following are other valid items to troubleshoot in this scenario? (Choose two.)

A. Verify that the 0.0.0.0/0 route in the route table for the web server subnet points to a NAT gateway.
B. Verify which Security Group is applied to the particular web server's elastic network interface (ENI).

C. Verify that the 0.0.0.0/0 route in the route table for the web server subnet points to the virtual security
appliance.

D. Verify the registered targets in the ALB.
E. Verify that the 0.0.0.0/0 route in the public subnet points to a NAT gateway.
