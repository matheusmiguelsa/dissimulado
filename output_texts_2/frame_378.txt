402) A security engineer is designing an IAM policy for a script that will use the AWS CLI. The script currently assumes an
IAM role that is attached to three AWS managed IAM policies: AmazonEC2FullAccess, AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess, and
AmazonVPCFullAccess.

The security engineer needs to construct a least privilege IAM policy that will replace the AWS managed IAM policies that
are attached to this role.

Which solution will meet these requirements in the MOST operationally efficient way?

A. In AWS CloudTrail, create a trail for management events. Run the script with the existing AWS managed IAM policies.
Use IAM Access Analyzer to generate a new IAM policy that is based on access activity in the trail. Replace the existing
AWS managed IAM policies with the generated IAM policy for the role.

B. Remove the existing AWS managed IAM policies from the role. Attach the IAM Access Analyzer Role Policy Generator
to the role. Run the script. Return to [AM Access Analyzer and generate a least privilege IAM policy. Attach the new [AM
policy to the role.

C. Create an account analyzer in IAM Access Analyzer. Create an archive rule that has a filter that checks whether the
PrincipalArn value matches the ARN of the role. Run the script. Remove the existing AWS managed IAM policies from the
role.

D. In AWS CloudTrail, create a trail for management events. Remove the existing AWS managed IAM policies from the
role. Run the script. Find the authorization failure in the trail event that is associated with the script. Create a new IAM
policy that includes the action and resource that caused the authorization failure. Repeat the process until the script
succeeds. Attach the new IAM policy to the role.
