304) An audit determined that a company's Amazon EC2 instance security group violated company policy by allowing
unrestricted incoming SSH traffic. A security engineer must implement a near-real-time monitoring and alerting solution that
will notify administrators of such violations.

Which solution meets these requirements with the MOST operational efficiency?

A.Create a recurring Amazon Inspector assessment run that runs every day and uses the Network Reachability package.
Create an Amazon CloudWatch rule that invokes an IAM Lambda function when an assessment run starts. Configure the
Lambda function to retrieve and evaluate the assessment run report when it completes. Configure the Lambda function also to
publish an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notification if there are any violations for unrestricted incoming
SSH traffic.

B.Use the restricted-ssh [AM Config managed rule that is invoked by security group configuration changes that are not
compliant. Use the IAM Config remediation feature to publish a message to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon
SNS) topic.

C.Configure VPC Flow Logs for the VP and specify an Amazon CloudWatch Logs group. Subscribe the CloudWatch Logs group
to an IAM Lambda function that parses new log entries, detects successful connections on port 22, and publishes a
notification through Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS).

D.Create a recurring Amazon Inspector assessment run that runs every day and uses the Security Best Practices package.
Create an Amazon CloudWatch rule that invokes an IAM Lambda function when an assessment run starts. Configure the
Lambda function to retrieve and evaluate the assessment run report when it completes. Configure the Lambda function also to
publish an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notification if there are any violations for unrestricted incoming
SSH traffic.
