278) A company needs to use HTTPS when connecting to its web applications to meet compliance requirements. These web
applications run in Amazon VPC on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). A security engineer

wants to ensure that the load balancer win only accept connections over port 443. even if the ALB is mistakenly configured
with an HTTP listener.

Which configuration steps should the security engineer take to accomplish this task?

A.Create a security group with a rule that denies Inbound connections from 0.0.0 0/0 on port 00.

Attach this security group to the ALB to overwrite more permissive rules from the ALB's default security group.
B.Create a network ACL that denies inbound connections from 0 0.0.0/0 on port 80 Associate the network ACL with
the VPC s internet gateway.

C.Create a network ACL that allows outbound connections to the VPC IP range on port 443 only.

Associate the network ACL with the VPCâ€™s internet gateway.

D.Create a security group with a single inbound rule that allows connections from 0.0.0 0/0 on port 443. Ensure this
security group is the only one associated with the ALB
