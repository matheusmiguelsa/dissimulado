234. Amazon GuardDuty has detected communications to a known command and control endpoint
from a company's Amazon EC2 instance. The instance was found to be running a vulnerable version of
a common web framework. The company's security operations team wants to quickly identify other
compute resources with the specific version of that framework installed.

Which approach should the team take to accomplish this task?

A. Scan all the EC2 instances for noncompliance with AWS Config. Use Amazon Athena to query AWS
CloudTrail logs for the framework installation.

B. Scan all the EC2 instances with the Amazon Inspector Network Reachability rules package to
identify instances running a web server with RecognizedPortWithListener findings.

C. Scan all the EC2 instances with AWS Systems Manager to identify the vulnerable version of the web
framework.

D. Scan all the EC2 instances with AWS Resource Access Manager to identify the vulnerable version of
the web framework.
