392) A company has an AWS account that includes an Amazon $3 bucket. The S3 bucket uses server-side encryption with
AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS) to encrypt all the objects at rest by using a customer managed key. The $3 bucket does not have a
bucket policy.

An |AM role in the same account has an IAM policy that allows s3 List* and s3 Get' permissions for the S3 bucket. When the
IAM role attempts to access an object in the $3 bucket the role receives an access denied message.

Why does the IAM rote not have access to the objects that are in the S3 bucket?

A. The IAM rote does not have permission to use the KMS CreateKey operation.

B. The S3 bucket lacks a policy that allows access to the customer managed key that encrypts the objects.

C. The IAM rote does not have permission to use the customer managed key that encrypts the objects that are in the S3
bucket.

D. The ACL of the $3 objects does not allow read access for the objects when the objects ace encrypted at rest.

Correct Answer: C
