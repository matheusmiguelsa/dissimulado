key to allow access only if the request conies from the specified IP addresses.

C. Create a CloudFront origin access identity (OAl). Create the S3 bucket policy so that only the OAl has access. Create
an AWS WAF web ACL and add an IP set rule. Associate the web ACL with the CloudFront distribution.
