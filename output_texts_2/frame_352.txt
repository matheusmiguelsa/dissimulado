390) A company wants to prevent SSH access through the use of SSH key pairs for any Amazon Linux 2 Amazon EC2 instances
in its AWS account. However, a system administrator occasionally will need to access these EC2 instances through SSH in an
emergency. For auditing purposes, the company needs to record any commands that a user runs in an EC2 instance.

What should a security engineer do to configure access to these EC2 instances to meet these requirements?

A. Use the EC2 serial console. Configure the EC2 serial console to save all commands that are entered to an Amazon S3
bucket. Provide the EC2 instances with an IAM role that allows the EC2 serial console to access Amazon S3. Configure an
IAM account for the system administrator. Provide an IAM policy that allows the IAM account to use the EC2 serial console,

B. Use EC2 Instance Connect. Configure EC2 Instance Connect to save all commands that are entered to Amazon
CloudWatch Logs. Provide the EC2 instances with an IAM role that allows the EC2 Instances to access CloudWatch Logs.
Configure an IAM account for the system administrator. Provide an IAM policy that allows the [AM account to use EC2
Instance Connect.

C. Use an EC2 key pair with an EC2 instance that needs SSH access. Access the EC2 instance with this key pair by using
SSH. Configure the EC2 instance to save all commands that are entered to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Provide the EC2
instance with an IAM role that allows the EC2 instance to access Amazon S3 and CloudWatch Logs.

D. Use AWS Systems Manager Session Manager. Configure Session Manager to save all commands that are entered ina
session to an Amazon S3 bucket. Provide the EC2 instances with an IAM role that allows Systems Manager to manage the
EC2 instances. Configure an IAM account for the system administrator. Provide an IAM policy that allows the IAM account
to use Session Manager.
