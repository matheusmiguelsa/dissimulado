147. A company's Developers plan to migrate their on-premises applications to Amazon EC2 instances running Amazon Linux
AMIs. The applications are accessed by a group of partner companies. The Security Engineer needs to implement the following
host-based security measures for these instances:

~® Block traffic from documented known bad IP addresses.

“® Detect known software vulnerabilities and CIS Benchmarks compliance.

Which solution addresses these requirements?

A. Launch the EC2 instances with an IAM role attached. Include a user data script that uses the AWS CLI to retrieve the list of bad
IP addresses from AWS Secrets Manager, and uploads it as a threat list in Amazon GuardDuty. Use Amazon Inspector to scan the
instances for known software vulnerabilities and CIS Benchmarks compliance.

B. Launch the EC2 instances with an IAM role attached. Include a user data script that uses the AWS CLI to create NACLs
blocking ingress traffic from the known bad IP addresses in the EC2 instance's subnets. Use AWS Systems Manager to scan the
instances for known software vulnerabilities, and AWS Trusted Advisor to check instances for CIS Benchmarks compliance.

C. Launch the EC2 instances with an IAM role attached. Include a user data script that uses the AWS CLI to create and attach
security groups that only allow an allow listed source IP address range inbound. Use Amazon Inspector to scan the instances for
known software vulnerabilities, and AWS Trusted Advisor to check instances for CIS Benchmarks compliance.

D. Launch the EC2 instances with an IAM role attached. Include a user data script that creates a cron job to periodically retrieve
the list of bad IP addresses from Amazon S3, and configures iptables on the instances blocking the list of bad IP addresses. Use
Amazon Inspector to scan the instances for known software vulnerabilities and CIS Benchmarks compliance.

Answer: D
