376) A company uses AWS Organizations. The company wants to implement short-term cre-dentials for third-party AWS
accounts to use to access accounts within the com-pany's organization. Access is for the AWS Management Console and
third-party software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications. Trust must be enhanced to prevent two external accounts from using
the same credentials. The solution must require the least possible operational effort.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Use a bearer token authentication with OAuth or SAML to manage and share a central Amazon Cognito user
pool across multiple Amazon API Gateway APIs.

B. Create a unique IAM role for each external account. Create a trust policy that includes a condition that uses
the sts:Externalld condition key.

C. Create a unique IAM role for each external account. Create a trust policy. Use AWS Secrets Manager to create
a random external key.

D. Implement AWS IAM Identity Center (AWS Single Sign-On), and use an identi-ty source of choice. Grant
access to users and groups from other accounts by using permission sets that are assigned by account.

Correct Answer: B
