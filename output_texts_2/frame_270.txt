resource in the account is compromised The company determines that the compromised resource is an Amazon EC2 instance
that hosts a web application The compromised EC2 instance is part of an EC2 Auto Scaling group.

The EC2 instance accesses Amazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB resources by using an 1AM access key and secret key The 1AM
access key and secret key are stored inside the AMI that is specified in the Auto Scaling group's launch configuration The
company is concerned that the credentials that are stored in the AMI might also have been exposed.

The company must implement a solution that remediates the security concerns without causing downtime for the application
The solution must comply with security best practices.

Which solution will meet these requirementsâ€™?

A.Rotate the potentially compromised access key that the EC2 instance uses Create a new AM | without the potentially
compromised credentials Perform an EC2 Auto Scaling instance refresh.

B.Delete or deactivate the potentially compromised access key Create an EC2 Auto Scaling linked 1AM role that includes a
custom policy that matches the potentially compromised access key permission Associate the new 1AM role with the Auto
Scaling group Perform an EC2 Auto Scaling instance refresh.

C.Delete or deactivate the potentially compromised access key Create a new AMI without the potentially compromised
credentials Create an 1AM role that includes the correct permissions Create a launch template for the Auto Scaling group to
reference the new AMI and 1AM role Perform an EC2 Auto Scaling instance refresh.

D.Rotate the potentially compromised access key Create a new AMI without the potentially compromised access key Use a user
data script to supply the new access key as environmental variables in the Auto Scaling group's launch configuration Perform an

EC2 Auto Scaling instance refresh.
