192. A company manages multiple AWS accounts using AWS Organizations. The company's security
team notices that some member accounts are not sending AWS

CloudTrail logs to a centralized Amazon $3 logging bucket. The security team wants to ensure there is
at least one trail configured for all existing accounts and for any account that is created in the future.

Which set of actions should the security team implement to accomplish this?

A. Create a new trail and configure it to send CloudTrail logs to Amazon S3. Use Amazon EventBridge
(Amazon CloudWatch Events) to send notification if a trail is deleted or stopped.

B. Deploy an AWS Lambda function in every account to check if there is an existing trail and create a
new trail, if needed.

C. Edit the existing trail in the Organizations master account and apply it to the organization.

D. Create an SCP to deny the cloudtrail:Delete* and cloudtrail:Stop* actions. Apply the SCP to all
accounts.

Answer: C
