A. Create an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. Subscribe the security team's email addresses to the
SNS topic. Create custom rules in CloudFormation Guard for each resource configuration. In the CIICD pipeline, before the build
stage, configure a Docker image to run the cfn-guard command on the CloudFormation template. Configure the Cl/CD pipeline
to publish a notification to the SNS topic if any issues are found.

B. Create a centralized CloudFormation stack set that includes a standard set of resources that the developers can deploy in
each AWS account. Configure each CloudFormation template to meet the security requirements. For any new resources or
configurations, update the CloudFormation template and send the template to the security team for review. When the review is
com-pleted, add the new CloudFormation stack to the repository for the devel-opers to use.

C. Create an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. Subscribe the security teamâ€™s email addresses to the
SNS topic. Create a custom AWS Lambda function that will run the aws cloudformation validate-template AWS CLI command on
all CloudFormation templates before the build stage in the CI/CD pipeline. Configure the Cl/CD pipeline to publish a notification
to the SNS topic if any issues are found.

D. Create an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic and an Am-azon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS)
queue. Subscribe the security team's email addresses to the SNS topic. Create an Amazon S3 bucket in the shared services
AWS account. Include an event notification to publish to the SQS queue when new objects are added to the S3 bucket. Require
the de-velopers to put their CloudFormation templates in the S3 bucket. Launch EC2 instances that automatically scale based
on the SQS queue depth. Con-figure the EC2 instances to use CloudFormation Guard to scan the templates and deploy the
templates if there are no issues. Configure the CIICD pipe-line to publish a notification to the SNS topic if any issues are found.
