449) A company is testing its incident response plan for compromised credentials. The company runs a database on an
Amazon EC2 instance and stores the sensitive database credentials as a secret in AWS Secrets Manager. The secret has
rotation configured with an AWS Lambda function that uses the generic rotation function template. The EC2 instance and the
Lambda function are deployed in the same private subnet. The VPC has a Secrets Manager VPC endpoint.

A security engineer discovers that the secret cannot rotate. The security engineer determines that the VPC endpoint is working
as intended. The Amazon CloudWatch logs contain the following error: "setSecret: Unable to log into database‚Äù.

Which solution will resolve this error?

A. Use the AWS Management Console to edit the JSON structure of the secret in Secrets Manager so that the secret
automatically conforms with the structure that the database requires.

B. Ensure that the security group that is attached to the Lambda function allows outbound connections to the EC2
instance. Ensure that the security group that is attached to the EC2 instance allows inbound connections from the
security group that is attached to the Lambda function.

C. Use the Secrets Manager list-secrets command in the AWS CLI to list the secret. Identify the database credentials.
Use the Secrets Manager rotate-secret command in the AWS CLI to force the immediate rotation of the secret.

D. Add an internet gateway to the VPC. Create a NAT gateway in a public subnet. Update the VPC route tables so that
traffic from the Lambda function and traffic from the EC2 instance can reach the Secrets Manager public endpoint.
