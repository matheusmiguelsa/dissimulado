103. The AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store is being used to store database passwords used by
an AWS Lambda function. Because this is sensitive data, the parameters are stored as type
SecureString and protected by an AWS KMS key that allows access through IAM. When the function
executes, this parameter cannot be retrieved as the result of an access denied error.

Which of the following actions will resolve the access denied error?

A. Update the ssm.amazonaws.com principal in the KMS key policy to allow kms: Decrypt.

B. Update the Lambda configuration to launch the function in a VPC.

C. Add a policy to the role that the Lambda function uses, allowing kms: Decrypt for the KMS key.
D. Add lambda.amazonaws.com as a trusted entity on the IAM role that the Lambda function uses.

Answer: C
