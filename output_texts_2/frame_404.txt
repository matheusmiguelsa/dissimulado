414) A company wants to monitor the deletion of customer managed CMkKs. A security engineer must create an alarm that
will notify the company before a CM lis deleted. The security engineer has configured the integration of AWS CloudTrail with
Amazon CloudWatch.

What should the security engineer do next to meet this requirement?

A. Within AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS), specify the deletion time of the key material during CMK
creation. AWS KMS will automatically create a CloudWatch alarm.

B. Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule to look for API calls of DeleteAlias. Create an
AWS Lambda function to send an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) message to the company.
Add the Lambda function as the target of the Eventbridge (CloudWatch Events) rule.

C. Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule to look for API calls of DisableKey and
ScheduleKeyDeletion. Create an AWS Lambda function to send an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon
SNS) message to the company. Add the Lambda function as the target of the Eventbridge (CloudWatch Events)
rule.

D. Create an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) policy to look for AWS Key Management Service
(AWS KMS) API calls of RevokeGrant and ScheduleKeyDeletion. Create an AWS Lambda function to generate the
alarm and send the notification to the company. Add the Lambda function as the target of the SNS policy.
