308) A company uses Amazon RDS for MySQL as a database engine for its applications. A recent security audit revealed an
RDS instance that is not compliant with company policy for encrypting data at rest. A security engineer at the company needs
to ensure that all existing RDS databases are encrypted using server-side encryption and that any future deviations from the
policy are detected.

Which combination of steps should the security engineer take to accomplish this? (Select TWO.)

A.Create an IAM Config rule to detect the creation of unencrypted RDS databases. Create an Amazon EventBridge
(Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule to trigger on the IAM Config rules compliance state change and use Amazon Simple
Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to notify the security operations team.

B.Use IAM System Manager State Manager to detect RDS database encryption configuration drift.

Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule to track state changes and use Amazon Simple
Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to notify the security operations team.

C.Create a read replica for the existing unencrypted RDS database and enable replica encryption in the process. Once the
replica becomes active, promote it into a standalone database instance and terminate the unencrypted database instance.
D.Take a snapshot of the unencrypted RDS database. Copy the snapshot and enable snapshot encryption in the process.
Restore the database instance from the newly created encrypted snapshot. Terminate the unencrypted database instance.
E.Enable encryption for the identified unencrypted RDS instance by changing the configurations of the existing database.
