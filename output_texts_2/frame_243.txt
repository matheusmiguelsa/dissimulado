341) A company uses AWS Organizations to manage several AWs accounts. The company processes a large volume of
sensitive dat.

A.The company uses a serverless approach to microservices. The company stores all the data in either Amazon S3 or
Amazon DynamoDB. The company reads the data by using either AWS lambda functions or container-based services
that the company hosts on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) on AWS Fargate.

The company must implement a solution to encrypt all the data at rest and enforce least privilege data access
controls. The company creates an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed key.

What should the company do next to meet these requirements?

B.Create a key policy that allows the kms:Decrypt action only for Amazon S3 and DynamoD Create an SCP that denies
the creation of $3 buckets and DynamoDB tables that are not encrypted with the key.

C.Create an 1AM policy that denies the kms:Decrypt action for the key. Create a Lambda function than runs on a
schedule to attach the policy to any new roles. Create an AWS Config rule to send alerts for resources that are not
encrypted with the key.

D.Create a key policy that allows the kms:Decrypt action only for Amazon $3, DynamoDB, Lambda, and Amazon EKS.
Create an SCP that denies the creation of S3 buckets and DynamoDB tables that are not encrypted with the key.
E.Create a key policy that allows the kms:Decrypt action only for Amazon S3, DynamoDB, Lambda, and Amazon EKS.
Create an AWS Config rule to send alerts for resources that are not encrypted with the key.
