232. A company has a web-based application using Amazon CloudFront and running on Amazon
Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) behind an Application Load

Balancer (ALB). The ALB is terminating TLS and balancing load across ECS service tasks. A security
engineer needs to design a solution to ensure that application content is accessible only through
CloudFront and that it is never accessible directly.

How should the security engineer build the MOST secure solution?

A. Add an origin custom header. Set the viewer protocol policy to HTTP and HTTPS. Set the origin
protocol policy to HTTPS only. Update the application to validate the CloudFront custom header.

B. Add an origin custom header. Set the viewer protocol policy to HTTPS only. Set the origin protocol
policy to match viewer. Update the application to validate the CloudFront custom header.

C. Add an origin custom header. Set the viewer protocol policy to redirect HTTP to HTTPS. Set the
origin protocol policy to HTTP only. Update the application to validate the CloudFront custom header.

D. Add an origin custom header. Set the viewer protocol policy to redirect HTTP to HTTPS. Set the
origin protocol policy to HTTPS only. Update the application to validate the CloudFront custom header.

Answer: D
