357) A company uses SAML federation to grant users access to AWS accounts. A company workload that is in an isolated
AWS account runs on immutable infrastructure with no human access to Amazon EC2. The company requires a specialized
user known as a break glass user to have access to the workload AWS account and instances in the case of SAML errors. A
recent audit discovered that the company did not create the break glass user for the AWS account that contains the workload.
The company must create the break glass user. The company must log any activities of the break glass user and send the
logs to a security team.

Which combination of solutions will meet these requirements? (Select TWO.)

A. Create a break glass EC2 key pair for the AWS account. Provide the key pair to the security team. Use AWS CloudTrail to
monitor key pair activity. Send notifications to the security team by using Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS).
B. Create a local individual break glass IAM user for the security team. Create a trail in AWS CloudTrail that has Amazon
CloudWatch Logs turned on. Use Amazon EventBridge to monitor local user activities.

C. Configure AWS Systems Manager Session Manager for Amazon EC2. Configure an AWS Cloud Trail filter based on Session
Manager. Send the results to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic.

D. Create a local individual break glass IAM user on the operating system level of each workload instance. Configure
unrestricted security groups on the instances to grant access to the break glass IAM users.

E. Create a break glass IAM role for the account. Allow security team members to perform the AssumeRoleWithSAML
operation. Create an AWS Cloud Trail trail that has Amazon CloudWatch Logs turned on. Use Amazon EventBridge to monitor
security team activities.
