406) A company uses several AWS CloudFormation stacks to handle the deployment of a suite of applications. The leader of
the company's application development team notices that the stack deployments fail with permission errors when some team
members try to deploy the stacks. However, other team members can deploy the stacks successfully.

The team members access the account by assuming a role that has a specific set of permissions that are necessary for the
job responsibilities of the team members. All team members have permissions to perform operations on the stacks.

Which combination of steps will ensure consistent deployment of the stacks MOST securely? (Choose three.)

A. Create a service role that has a composite principal that contains each service that needs the necessary
permissions. Configure the role to allow the sts:AssumeRole action.

B. Create a service role that has cloudformation.amazonaws.com as the service principal. Configure the role to allow
the sts:AssumeRole action.

C. For each required set of permissions, add a separate policy to the role to allow those permissions. Add the ARN of
each CloudFormation stack in the resource field of each policy.

D. For each required set of permissions, add a separate policy to the role to allow those permissions. Add the ARN of
each service that needs the permissions in the resource field of the corresponding policy.

E. Update each stack to use the service role.
F Add a policy to each member role to allow the iam:PassRole action. Set the policy's resource field to the ARN of the
service role.
