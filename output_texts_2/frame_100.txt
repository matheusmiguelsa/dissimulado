other from web servers running EC2 instances behind an Application. Load Balancer (ALB). Amazon DynamoDB is used as the

A.Update the CloudFront distribution. configuring it to optionally use HTTPS when connecting to origins on Amazon $3
B.Update the web application configuration on the web servers to use HTTPS instead of HTTP when connecting to
DynamoDB

C.Update the CloudFront distribution to redirect HTTP corrections to HTTPS

D.Configure the web servers on the EC2 instances to listen using HTTPS using the public ACM TLS certificate Update the
ALB to connect to the target group using HTTPS

E.Update the ALB listen to listen using HTTPS using the public ACM TLS certificate. Update the CloudFront distribution to
connect to the HTTPS listener.

F.Create a TLS certificate Configure the web servers on the EC2 instances to use HTTPS only with that certificate. Update
the ALB to connect to the target group using HTTPS.
