364) A company has a web-based application that runs behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The application is
experiencing a credential stuffing attack that is producing many failed login attempts. The attack is coming from many
IP addresses. The login attempts are using a user agent string of a known mobile device emulator.

A security engineer needs to implement a solution to mitigate the credential stuffing attack. The solution must still
allow legitimate logins to the application.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Create an AWS WAF web ACL for the ALB Create a custom rule that allows requests from legitimate
user agent strings

B. Create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm that reacts to login attempts that contain the specified user
agent string. Add an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to the alarm.

C. Create an AWS WAF web ACL for the ALB. Create a custom rule that blocks requests that contain the
user agent string of the device emulator.

D. Modify the inbound security group on the ALB to deny traffic from the IP addresses that are involved
in the attack.

Correct Answer: C
