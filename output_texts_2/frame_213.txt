327) A company has two teams, and each team needs to access its respective Amazon $3 buckets. The company anticipates
adding more teams that also will have their own S3 buckets.

When the company adds these teams, team members will need the ability to be assigned to multiple teams. Team members
also will need the ability to change teams. Additional S3 buckets can be created or deleted.

An IAM administrator must design a solution to accomplish these goals. The solution also must be scalable and must require
the least possible operational overhead.

Which solution meets these requirements?

A.Add users to groups that represent the teams. Create a policy for each team that allows the team to access its
respective S3 buckets only. Attach the policy to the corresponding group.

B.Create an IAM role for each team. Create a policy for each team that allows the team to access its respective $3
buckets only. Attach the policy to the corresponding role.

C.Create IAM roles that are labeled with an access tag value of a team. Create one policy that allows dynamic
access to $3 buckets with the same tag. Attach the policy to the IAM roles. Tag the $3 buckets accordingly.
D.Implement a role-based access control (RBAC) authorization model. Create the corresponding policies, and attach
them to the IAM users.
