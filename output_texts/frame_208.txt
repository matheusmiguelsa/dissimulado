102. A company has Windows Amazon EC2 instances in a VPC that are joined to on-premises Active
Directory servers for domain services. The security team has enabled Amazon GuardDuty on the AWS
account to alert on issues with the instances.

During a weekly audit of network traffic, the Security Engineer notices that one of the EC2 instances is
attempting to communicate with a known command-and- control server but failing. This alert does not
show up in GuardDuty.

Why did GuardDuty fail to alert to this behavior?

A. GuardDuty did not have the appropriate alerts activated.

B. GuardDuty does not see these DNS requests.

C. GuardDuty only monitors active network traffic flow for command-and-control activity.
D. GuardDuty does not report on command-and-control activity.

Answer: B
