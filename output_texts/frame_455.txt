225. A company uses an external identity provider to allow federation into different AWS accounts. A
security engineer for the company needs to identify the federated user that terminated a production
Amazon EC2 instance a week ago.

What is the FASTEST way for the security engineer to identify the federated user?

A. Review the AWS CloudTrail event history logs in an Amazon S3 bucket and look for the
Terminatelnstances event to identify the federated user from the role session name.

B. Filter the AWS CloudTrail event history for the Terminatelnstances event and identify the assumed
IAM role. Review the AssumeRoleWithSAML event call in CloudTrail to identify the corresponding
username.

C. Search the AWS CloudTrail logs for the Terminatelnstances event and note the event time. Review
the IAM Access Advisor tab for all federated roles. The last accessed time should match the time when
the instance was terminated.

D. Use Amazon Athena to run a SQL query on the AWS CloudTrail logs stored in an Amazon S3 bucket
and filter on the Terminatelnstances event. Identify the corresponding role and run another query to
filter the AssumeRoleWithWebldentity event for the user name.
