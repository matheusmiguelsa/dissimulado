164. A company's architecture requires that its three Amazon EC2 instances run behind an Application
Load Balancer (ALB). The EC2 instances transmit sensitive data between each other. Developers use
SSL certificates to encrypt the traffic between the public users and the ALB. However, the Developers
are unsure of how to encrypt the data in transit between the ALB and the EC2 instances and the traffic
between the EC2 instances.

Which combination of activities must the company implement to meet its encryption requirements?
(Choose two.)

A. Configure SSL/TLS on the EC2 instances and configure the ALB target group to use HTTPS.

B. Ensure that all resources are in the same VPC so the default encryption provided by the VPC is used
to encrypt the traffic between the EC2 instances.

C. In the ALB, select the default encryption to encrypt the traffic between the ALB and the EC2
instances.

D. In the code for the application, include a cryptography library and encrypt the data before sending it
between the EC2 instances.

E. Configure AWS Direct Connect to provide an encrypted tunnel between the EC2 instances.

Answer: A, D
