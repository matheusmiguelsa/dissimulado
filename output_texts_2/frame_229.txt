334) Within a VPC, a corporation runs an Amazon RDS Multi-AZ DB instance. The database instance is connected to the internet
through a NAT gateway via two subnets.

Additionally, the organization has application servers that are hosted on Amazon EC2 instances and use the RDS database.
These EC2 instances have been deployed onto two more private subnets inside the same VPC. These EC2 instances connect to
the internet through a default route via the same NAT gateway. Each VPC subnet has its own route table.

The organization implemented a new security requirement after a recent security examination. Never allow the database
instance to connect to the internet. A security engineer must perform this update promptly without interfering with the network
traffic of the application servers.

How will the security engineer be able to comply with these requirements?

A.Remove the existing NAT gateway. Create a new NAT gateway that only the application server subnets can use.
B.Configure the DB instance TMs inbound network ACL to deny traffic from the security group ID of the NAT
gateway.

C.Modify the route tables of the DB instance subnets to remove the default route to the NAT gateway.
D.Configure the route table of the NAT gateway to deny connections to the DB instance subnets.

Answer: C
