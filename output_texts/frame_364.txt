Which option meets these requirements?

A. Use an AWS KMS customer managed key and store the key material in AWS with replication across
Regions.

B. Use an AWS customer managed key, import the key material into AWS KMS using in-house AWS
CloudHSM, and store the key material securely in Amazon $3.

C. Use an AWS KMS custom key store backed by AWS CloudHSM clusters, and copy backups across
Regions.

D. Use AWS CloudHSM to generate the key material and backup keys across Regions. Use the Java
Cryptography Extension (JCE) and Public Key Cryptography Standards #11 (PKCS #11) encryption
libraries to encrypt and decrypt the data.
