121. A Security Engineer is setting up an AWS CloudTrail trail for all regions in an AWS account. For
added security, the logs are stored using server-side encryption with AWS KMS-managed keys (SSE-
KMS) and have log integrity validation enabled.

While testing the solution, the Security Engineer discovers that the digest files are readable, but the log
files are not. What is the MOST likely cause?

A. The log files fail integrity validation and automatically are marked as unavailable.

B. The KMS key policy does not grant the Security Engineer's IAM user or role permissions to decrypt
with it.

C. The bucket is set up to use server-side encryption with Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE-S3) as the
default and does not allow SSE-KMS-encrypted files.

D. An IAM policy applicable to the Security Engineer's IAM user or role denies access to the
"CloudTrail/" prefix in the Amazon $3 bucket.

Answer: B
