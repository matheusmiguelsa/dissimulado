432) A company developed an application by using AWS Lambda, Amazon $3, Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon
SNS), and Amazon DynamoDB. An external application puts objects into the company's $3 bucket and tags the objects with
date and time. A Lambda function periodically pulls data from the company's S3 bucket based on date and time tags and
inserts specific values into a DynamoDB table for further processing.

The data includes personally identifiable information (PII). The company must remove data that is older than 30 days from
the S3 bucket and the DynamoDB table.

Which solution will meet this requirement with the MOST operational efficiency?

A. Update the Lambda function to add a TTL S3 flag to S3 objects. Create an S3 Lifecycle policy to expire objects
that are older than 30 days by using the TTL $3 flag.

B. Create an $3 Lifecycle policy to expire objects that are older than 30 days. Update the Lambda function to add
the TTL attribute in the DynamoDB table. Enable TTL on the DynamoDB table to expire entries that are older than 30
days based on the TTL attribute.

C. Create an S3 Lifecycle policy to expire objects that are older than 30 days and to add all prefixes to the $3
bucket. Update the Lambda function to delete entries that are older than 30 days.

D. Create an $3 Lifecycle policy to expire objects that are older than 30 days by using object tags. Update the
Lambda function to delete entries that are older than 30 days.

Answer: B
