288) A company is running workloads in a single IAM account on Amazon EC2 instances and Amazon EMR clusters a
recent security audit revealed that multiple Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes and snapshots are not
encrypted.

The company's security engineer is working on a solution that will allow users to deploy EC2 Instances and EMR clusters
while ensuring that all new EBS volumes and EBS snapshots are encrypted at rest. The solution must also minimize
operational overhead.

Which steps should the security engineer take to meet these requirements?

A.Create an Amazon Event Bridge (Amazon Cloud watch Events) event with an EC2 instance as the source and create
volume as the event trigger.

When the event is triggered invoke an IAM Lambda function to evaluate and notify the security engineer if the EBS
volume that was created is not encrypted.

B.Use a customer managed IAM policy that will verify that the encryption flag of the Createvolume context is set to
true. Apply this rule to all users.

C.Create an IAM Config rule to evaluate the configuration of each EC2 instance on creation or modification. Have the
IAM Config rule trigger an IAM Lambdafunction to alert the security team and terminate the instance it the EBS
volume is not encrypted. 5

D.Use the IAM Management Console or IAM CLi to enable encryption by default for EBS volumes in each IAM Region
where the company operates.
