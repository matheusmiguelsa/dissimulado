174. A company's web application is hosted on Amazon EC2 instances running behind an Application
Load Balancer (ALB) in an Auto Scaling group. An AWS WAF web ACL is associated with the ALB. AWS
CloudTrail is enabled, and stores logs in Amazon S3 and Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

The Operations team has observed some EC2 instances reboot at random. After rebooting, all access
logs on the instances have been deleted. During an investigation, the Operations team found that each
reboot happened just after a PHP error occurred on the new-user-creation.php file. The Operations
team needs to view log information to determine if the company is being attacked.

Which set of actions will identify the suspect attacker's IP address for future occurrences?

A. Configure VPC Flow Logs on the subnet where the ALB is located, and stream the data CloudWatch.
Search for the new-user-creation.php occurrences in CloudWatch.

B. Configure the CloudWatch agent on the ALB. Configure the agent to send application logs to
CloudWatch. Update the instance role to allow CloudWatch Logs access. Export the logs to
CloudWatch. Search for the new-user-creation.php occurrences in CloudWatch.

C. Configure the ALB to export access logs to an Amazon Elasticsearch Service cluster, and use the
service to search for the new-user-creation.php occurrences.

D. Configure the web ACL to send logs to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose, which delivers the logs to an
$3 bucket. Use Amazon Athena to query the logs and find the new-user- creation. php occurrences.

Answer: D
