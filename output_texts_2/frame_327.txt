380) A company is designing a multi-account structure for its development teams. The company is using AWS
Organizations and AWS Single Sign-On (AWS SSO). The company must implement a solution so that the development
teams can use only specific AWS Regions and so that each AWS account allows access to only specific AWS services.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

A. Deactivate AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) in Regions that the developers are not allowed to
use.

B. For each AWS account, create tailored identity-based policies for AWS SSO. Use statements that
include the Condition, Resource, and NotAction elements to allow access to only the Regions and
services that are needed.

C. Use AWS SSO to set up service-linked roles with IAM policy statements that include the Condition,
Resource, and NotAction elements to allow access to only the Regions and services that are needed.

D. Create SCPs that include the Condition, Resource, and NotAction elements to allow access to only the
Regions and services that are needed.

Correct Answer: D
