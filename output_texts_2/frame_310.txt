372) A company is using AWS to run a long-running analysis process on data that is stored in Amazon $3 buckets.
The process runs on a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances that are in an Auto Scaling group. The EC2 instances are
deployed in a private subnet Of a VPC that does not have internet access. The EC2 instances and the S3 buckets
are in the same AWS account The EC2 instances access the S3 buckets through an S3 gateway endpoint that has
the default access policy. Each EC2 instance is associated With an instance profile role that has a policy that
explicitly allows the s3:GetObject action and the s3:PutObject action for only the required S3 buckets.

The company learns that one or more of the EC2 instances are compromised and are exfiltrating data to an S3
bucket that is outside the companys organization in AWS Organizations. A security engtneer must implement a
solution to stop this exfiltration of data and to keep the EC2 processing job functional.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Update the policy on the $3 gateway endpoint to allow the S3 actions CY11y if the values of the aws:ResourceOrgID
and aws:PrincipalOrglD condition keys match the companys values.

B. Update the policy on the instance profile role to allow the S3 actions only if the value of the aws:ResourceOrglD
condition key matches the company's value.

C. Add a network ACL rule to the subnet of the EC2 instances to block outgoing connections on port 443.

D. Apply an SCP on the AWS account to allow the $3 actions only if the values of the aws:ResourceOrglD and
aws:PrincipalOrgID condition keys match the company's values.

Correct Answer: D
