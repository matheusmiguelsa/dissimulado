90. An organization operates a web application that serves users globally. The application runs on Amazon
EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer.

There is an Amazon CloudFront distribution in front of the load balancer, and the organization uses AWS
WAF. The application is currently experiencing a volumetric attack whereby the attacker is exploiting a bug
in a popular mobile game.

The application is being flooded with HTTP requests from all over the world with the User-Agent set to the
following string: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; ExampleCorp;

ExampleGame/1.22; Mobile/1.0)

What mitigation can be applied to block attacks resulting from this bug while continuing to service
legitimate requests?

A. Create a rule in AWS WAF rules with conditions that block requests based on the presence of
ExampleGame/1.22 in the User-Agent header

B. Create a geographic restriction on the CloudFront distribution to prevent access to the application from
most geographic regions

C. Create a rate-based rule in AWS WAF to limit the total number of requests that the web application
services.

D. Create an IP-based blacklist in AWS WAF to block the IP addresses that are originating from requests that
contain ExampleGame/1.22 in the User-Agent header.
