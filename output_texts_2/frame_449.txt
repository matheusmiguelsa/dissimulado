434) A web application gives users the ability to log in, verify their membershipâ€™s validity, and browse artifacts that are
stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. When a user attempts to download an object, the application must verify the permission to
access the object and allow the user to download the object from a custom domain name such as example.com.

What is the MOST secure way for a security engineer to implement this functionality?

A. Configure read-only access to the object by using a bucket ACL. Remove the access after
a set time has elapsed.

B. Implement an IAM policy to give the user read access to the S3 bucket.

C. Create an S3 presigned URL. Provide the $3 presigned URL to the user through the
application.

D. Create an Amazon CloudFront signed URL. Provide the CloudFront signed URL to the user
through the application.

Answer: D
