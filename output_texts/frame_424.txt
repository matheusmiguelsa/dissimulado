210. A company is using AWS Organizations to manage multiple AWS member accounts. All of these
accounts have Amazon GuardDu Y enabled in all Regions. The company s AWS Security Operations Center
has a centralized security account for logging and monitoring. One of the member accounts has received an
excessively high bill. A security engineer discovers that a compromised Amazon EC2 instance is being used

to mine cryptocurrency. The Security Operations

Center did not receive a GuardDuty finding in the central security account, but there was a GuardDuty finding
in the account containing the compromised EC2 instance. The security engineer needs to ensure all
GuardDuty findings are available in the security account.

What should the security engineer do to resolve this issue?

A. Set up an Amazon CloudWatch Events rule to forward all GuardDuty findings to the security account. Use
an AWS Lambda function as a target to raise findings.

B. Set up an Amazon CloudWatch Events rule to forward all GuardDuty findings to the security account. Use
an AWS Lambda function as a target to raise findings in AWS Security Hub.

C. Check that GuardDuty in the security account is able to assume a role in the compromised account using
the quardduty.listfindings permission. Schedule an Amazon CloudWatch Events rule and an AWS Lambda
function to periodically check for GuardDuty findings.

D. Use the aws guardduty get-members AWS CLI command in the security account to see if the account is
listed. Send an invitation from GuardDuty in the security account to GuardDuty in the compromised account.
