229.A company is collecting AWS CloudTrail log data from multiple AWS accounts by managing individual
trails in each account and forwarding log data to a centralized Amazon $3 bucket residing in a log archive
account. After CloudTrail introduced su port for AWS Organizations trails, the company decided to further
centralize management and automate deployment of the CloudTrail logging capability across all of its AWS
accounts.

The company's security engineer created an AWS Organizations trail in the master account, enabled server-
side encryption with AWS KMS managed keys (SSE-

KMS) for the log files, and specified the same bucket as the storage location. However, the engineer noticed
that logs recorded by the new trail were not delivered to the bucket.

Which factors could cause this issue? (Choose two.)
A. The CMK key policy does not allow CloudTrail to make encrypt and decrypt API calls against the key.
B. The CMK key policy does not allow CloudTrail to make GenerateDatakey API calls against the key.

C. The IAM role used by the CloudTrail trail does not have permissions to make PutObject API calls against a
folder created for the Organizations trail.

D. The S3 bucket policy does not allow CloudTrail to make PutObject API calls against a folder created for
the Organizations trail.

E. The CMK key policy does not allow the IAM role used by the CloudTrail trail to use the key for
cryptographical operations.

Answer: B, D
