450) A company is designing a new application stack. The design includes web servers and backend servers that are hosted
on Amazon EC2 instances. The design also includes an Amazon Aurora MySQL DB cluster.

The EC2 instances are in an Auto Scaling group that uses launch templates. The EC2 instances for the web layer and the
backend layer are backed by Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes. No layers are encrypted at rest. A security
engineer needs to implement encryption at rest.

Which combination of steps will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

A. Modify EBS default encryption setting in the target AWS Region to enable encryption. Use an Auto Scaling group
instance refresh.

B. Modify the launch templates for the web layer and the backend layer to add AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)
encryption for the attached EBS volumes. Use an Auto Scaling group instance refresh.

C. Create a new AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) encrypted DB cluster from a snapshot of the existing
DB cluster.

D. Apply AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) encryption to the existing DB cluster.

E. Apply AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) encryption to the existing DB cluster.
