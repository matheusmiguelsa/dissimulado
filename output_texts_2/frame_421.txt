422) A company is investigating an increase in its AWS monthly bill. The company discovers that bad actors compromised
some Amazon EC2 instances and served webpages for a large email phishing campaign.

A security engineer must implement a solution to monitor for cost increases in the future to help detect malicious activity.

Which solution will offer the company the EARLIEST detection of cost increases?

A. Create an Amazon EventBridge rule that invokes an AWS Lambda function hourly. Program the Lambda
function to download an AWS usage report from AWS Data Exports about usage of all services. Program the
Lambda function to analyze the report and to send a notification when anomalies are detected.

B. Create a cost monitor in AWS Cost Anomaly Detection. Configure an individual alert to notify an Amazon
Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when the percentage above the expected cost exceeds a
threshold.

C. Review AWS Cost Explorer daily to detect anomalies in cost from prior months Review the usage of any
services that experience a significant cost increase from prior months.

D. Capture VPC flow logs from the VPC where the EC2 instances run. Use a third-party network analysis tool to
analyze the flow logs and to detect anomalies in network traffic that might increase cost.

Correct Answer: B
