425) A company needs a solution to protect critical data from being permanently deleted. The data is stored in Amazon $3
buckets.

The company needs to replicate the $3 objects from the company's primary AWS Region to a secondary Region to meet
disaster recovery requirements. The company must also ensure that users who have administrator access cannot
permanently delete the data in the secondary Region.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Configure AWS Backup to perform cross-Region S3 backups. Select a backup vault in the secondary Region.
Enable AWS Backup Vault Lock in governance mode for the backups in the secondary Region

B. Implement $3 Object Lock in compliance mode in the primary Region. Configure $3 replication to replicate the
objects to an $3 bucket in the secondary Region.

C. Configure S3 replication to replicate the objects to an S3 bucket in the secondary Region. Create an S3 bucket
policy to deny the s3:ReplicateDelete action on the S3 bucket in the secondary Region

D. Configure S3 replication to replicate the objects to an S3 bucket in the secondary Region. Configure S3 object
versioning on the S3 bucket in the secondary Region.
