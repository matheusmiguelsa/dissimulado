433) A company plans to use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to implement an encryption strategy to protect
data at rest. The company requires client-side encryption for company projects. The company is currently conducting
multiple projects to test the company's use of AWS KMS. These tests have led to a sudden increase in the company's AWS
resource consumption. The test projects include applications that issue multiple requests each second to KMS endpoints
for encryption activities.

The company needs to develop a solution that does not throttle the company's ability to use AWS KMS. The solution must
improve key usage for client-side encryption and must be cost optimized.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Use keyrings with the AWS Encryption SDK. Use each keyring individually or combine keyrings into a multi-keyring.
Decrypt the data by using a keyring that has the primary key in the multi-keyring.

B. Use data key caching. Use the local cache that the AWS Encryption SDK provides with a caching cryptographic
materials manager.

C. Use KMS key rotation. Use a local cache in the AWS Encryption SDK with a caching cryptographic materials
manager.

D. Use keyrings with the AWS Encryption SDK. Use each keyring individually or combine keyrings into a multi-keyring.
Use any of the wrapping keys in the multi-keyring to decrypt the data.

Answer: B
