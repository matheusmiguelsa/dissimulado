35. A Software Engineer wrote a customized reporting service that will run on a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances. The
company security policy states that application logs for the reporting service must be centrally collected.

What is the MOST efficient way to meet these requirements?

A. Write an AWS Lambda function that logs into the EC2 instance to pull the application logs from the EC2 instance and
persists them into an Amazon S3 bucket.

B. Enable AWS CloudTrail logging for the AWS account, create a new Amazon $3 bucket, and then configure Amazon
CloudWatch Logs to receive the application logs from CloudTrail.

C. Create a simple cron job on the EC2 instances that synchronizes the application logs to an Amazon S3 bucket by using
rsync.

D. Install the Amazon CloudWatch Logs Agent on the EC2 instances, and configure it to send the application logs to
CloudWatch Logs.

Answer: D
