209. A company's director of information security wants a daily email report from AWS that contains
recommendations for each company account to meet AWS

Security best practices.
Which solution would meet these requirements?

Advisor security checks. Send the results from Lambda to an Amazon SNS topic to send reports.

B. Configure Amazon GuardDuty in a master account and invite all other accounts to be managed by
the master account. Use GuardDuty's integration with Amazon SNS to report on findings.

C. Use Amazon Athena and Amazon QuickSight to build reports off of AWS CloudTrail. Create a daily
Amazon CloudWatch trigger to run the report daily and email it using Amazon SNS.

D. Use AWS Artifact's prebuilt reports and subscriptions. Subscribe the director of information security
to the reports by adding the director as the security alternate contact for each account.
