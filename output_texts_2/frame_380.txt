403) A company used a lift-and-shift approach to migrate from its on-premises data centers to the AWS Cloud. The company
migrated on-premises VMs to Amazon EC2 instances. Now the company wants to replace some of components that are
running on the EC2 instances with managed AWS services that provide similar functionality.

Initially, the company will transition from load balancer software that runs on EC2 instances to AWS Elastic Load Balancers. A
security engineer must ensure that after this transition, all the load balancer logs are centralized and searchable for auditing.
The security engineer must also ensure that metrics are generated to show which ciphers are in use.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Create an Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group. Configure the load balancers to send logs to the log group. Use the
CloudWatch Logs console to search the logs. Create CloudWatch Logs filters on the logs for the required metrics.

B. Create an Amazon $3 bucket. Configure the load balancers to send logs to the $3 bucket. Use Amazon Athena to
search the logs that are in the $3 bucket. Create Amazon CloudWatch filters on the S3 log files for the required metrics.
C. Create an Amazon S3 bucket. Configure the load balancers to send logs to the $3 bucket. Use Amazon Athena to
search the logs that are in the S3 bucket. Create Athena queries for the required metrics. Publish the metrics to Amazon
CloudWatch.

D. Create an Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group. Configure the load balancers to send logs to the log group. Use the
AWS Management Console to search the logs. Create Amazon Athena queries for the required metrics. Publish the
metrics to Amazon CloudWatch.
