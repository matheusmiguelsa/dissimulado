399) A company has thousands of AWS Lambda functions. While reviewing the Lambda functions, a security engineer
discovers that sensitive information is being stored in environment variables and is viewable as plaintext in the Lambda
console. The values of the sensitive information are only a few characters long.

What is the MOST cost-effective way to address this security issue?

A. Set up IAM policies from the Lambda console to hide access to the environment variables.

B. Use AWS Step Functions to store the environment variables. Access the environment variables at runtime.
Use IAM permissions to restrict access to the environment variables to only the Lambda functions that require
access.

C. Store the environment variables in AWS Secrets Manager, and access them at runtime. Use [AM
permissions to restrict access to the secrets to only the Lambda functions that require access.

D. Store the environment variables in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store as secure string parameters,
and access them at runtime. Use [AM permissions to restrict access to the parameters to only the Lambda
functions that require access.

Answer: D
