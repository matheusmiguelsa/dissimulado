217. A company's security officer is concerned about the risk of AWS account root user logins and has
assigned a security engineer to implement a notification solution for near-real-time alerts upon account root
user logins.

How should the security engineer meet these requirements?

A. Create a cron job that runs a script to download the AWS IAM security credentials file, parse
the file for account root user logins, and email the security team's distribution list.

B. Run AWS CloudTrail logs through Amazon CloudWatch Events to detect account root user
logins and trigger an AWS Lambda function to send an Amazon SNS notification to the security
team's distribution list.

C. Save AWS CloudTrail logs to an Amazon S3 bucket in the security team's account. Process the
CloudTrail logs with the security engineer's logging solution for account root user logins. Send an
Amazon SNS notification to the security team upon encountering the account root user login
events.

D. Save VPC Flow Logs to an Amazon $3 bucket in the security team's account, and process the
VPC Flow Logs with their logging solutions for account root user logins. Send an Amazon SNS
notification to the security team upon encountering the account root user login events.
