97. A company has five AWS accounts and wants to use AWS CloudTrail to log API calls. The log files must
be stored in an Amazon $3 bucket that resides in a new account specifically built for centralized services
with a unique top-level prefix for each trail. The configuration must also enable detection of any modification
to the logs.

Which of the following steps will implement these requirements? (Choose three.)

A. Create a new S3 bucket in a separate AWS account for centralized storage of CloudTrail logs, and enable
€aLog File Validation€ aon all trails.

B. Use an existing $3 bucket in one of the accounts, apply a bucket policy to the new centralized $3 bucket
that permits the CloudTrail service to use the "s3: PutObject" action and the "s3 GetBucketACL" action, and
specify the appropriate resource ARNs for the CloudTrail trails.

C. Apply a bucket policy to the new centralized S3 bucket that permits the CloudTrail service to use the "s3
PutCbject action and the "s3 GelBucketACL" action, and specify the appropriate resource ARNs for the
CloudTrail trails.

D. Use unique log file prefixes for trails in each AWS account.
