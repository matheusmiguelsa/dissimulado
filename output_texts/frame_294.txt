145. A company is operating an open-source software platform that is internet facing. The legacy software platform no
longer receives security updates. The software platform operates using Amazon Route 53 weighted load balancing to
send traffic to two Amazon EC2 instances that connect to an Amazon RDS cluster. A recent report suggests this software
platform is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks, with samples of attacks provided. The company's Security Engineer must
secure this system against SQL injection attacks within 24 hours. The Security Engineer's solution must involve the least
amount of effort and maintain normal operations during implementation.

What should the Security Engineer do to meet these requirements?

A. Create an Application Load Balancer with the existing EC2 instances as a target group. Create an AWS WAF web ACL
containing rules that protect the application from this attack, then apply it to the ALB. Test to ensure the vulnerability has
been mitigated, then redirect the Route 53 records to point to the ALB. Update security groups on the EC2 instances to
prevent direct access from the internet.

B. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution specifying one EC2 instance as an origin. Create an AWS WAF web ACL
containing rules that protect the application from this attack, then apply it to the distribution. Test to ensure the
vulnerability has been mitigated, then redirect the Route 53 records to point to CloudFront.

C. Obtain the latest source code for the platform and make the necessary updates. Test the updated code to ensure that
the vulnerability has been mitigated, then deploy the patched version of the platform to the EC2 instances.

D. Update the Security group that is attached to the EC2 instances, removing access from the internet to the TCP port
used by the SQL database. Create an AWS WAF web ACL containing rules that protect the application from this attack,
then apply it to the EC2 instances. Test to ensure the vulnerability has been mitigated, then restore the security group to
the original setting.
