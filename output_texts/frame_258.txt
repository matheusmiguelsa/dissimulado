127. A Security Engineer discovered a vulnerability in an application running on Amazon ECS. The
vulnerability allowed attackers to install malicious code. Analysis of the code shows it exfiltrates data
on port 5353 in batches at random time intervals.

While the code of the containers is being patched, how can Engineers quickly identify all compromised
hosts and stop the egress of data on port 5353?

A. Enable AWS Shield Advanced and AWS WAF. Configure an AWS WAF custom filter for egress traffic
on port 5353

B. Enable Amazon Inspector on Amazon ECS and configure a custom assessment to evaluate
containers that have port 5353 open. Update the NACLs to block port 5353 outbound.

C. Create an Amazon CloudWatch custom metric on the VPC Flow Logs identifying egress traffic on
port 5353. Update the NACLs to block port 5353 outbound.

D. Use Amazon Athena to query AWS CloudTrail logs in Amazon $3 and look for any traffic on port
5353. Update the security groups to block port 5353 outbound.

Answer: C
