198. A company's on-premises data center forwards DNS logs to a third-party security incident events
management (SIEM) solution that alerts on suspicious behavior.

The company wants to introduce a similar capability to its AWS accounts that includes automatic
remediation. The company expects to double in size within the next few months.

Which solution meets the company's current and future logging requirements?

A. Enable Amazon GuardDuty and AWS Security Hub in all Regions and all accounts. Designate a master
security account to receive all alerts from the child accounts. Set up specific rules within Amazon
EventBridge to trigger an AWS Lambda function for remediation steps.

B. Ingest all AWS CloudTrail logs, VPC Flow Logs, and DNS logs into a single Amazon S3 bucket in a
designated security account. Use the current on-premises SIEM to monitor the logs and send a notification
to an Amazon SNS topic to alert the security team of remediation steps.

C. Ingest all AWS CloudTrail logs, VPC Flow Logs, and DNS logs into a single Amazon $3 bucket in a
designated security account. Launch an Amazon EC2 instance and install the current SIEM to monitor the
logs and send a notification to an Amazon SNS topic to alert the security team of remediation steps.

D. Enable Amazon GuardDuty and AWS Security Hub in all Regions and all accounts. Designate a master
security account to receive all alerts from the child accounts. Create an AWS Organizations SCP that denies
access to certain API calls that are on an ignore list.
