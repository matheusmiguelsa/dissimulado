30. During a recent internal investigation, it was discovered that all API logging was disabled in a
production account, and the root user had created new API keys that appear to have been used several
times.

What could have been done to detect and automatically remediate the incident?

A. Using Amazon Inspector, review all of the API calls and configure the inspector agent to leverage
SNS topics to notify security of the change to AWS CloudTrail, and revoke the new API keys for the root
user.

B. Using AWS Config, create a config rule that detects when AWS CloudTrail is disabled, as well as any
calls to the root user create-api-key. Then use a Lambda function to re-enable CloudTrail logs and
deactivate the root API keys.

C. Using Amazon CloudWatch, create a CloudWatch event that detects AWS CloudTrail deactivation
and a separate Amazon Trusted Advisor check to automatically detect the creation of root API keys.
Then use a Lambda function to enable AWS CloudTrail and deactivate the root API keys.

D. Using Amazon CloudTrail, create a new CloudTrail event that detects the deactivation of CloudTrail
logs, and a separate CloudTrail event that detects the creation of root API keys. Then use a Lambda
function to enable CloudTrail and deactivate the root API keys.
