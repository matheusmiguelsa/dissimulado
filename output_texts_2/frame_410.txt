417) A security engineer needs to implement a solution to create and control the keys that a company uses for
cryptographic operations. The security engineer must create symmetric keys in which the key material is generated and
used within a custom key store that is backed by an AWS CloudHSM cluster.

The security engineer will use symmetric and asymmetric data key pairs for local use within applications. The security
engineer also must audit the use of the keys.

How can the security engineer meet these requirements?

A. To create the keys, use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) and the custom key stores with the
CloudHSM cluster. For auditing, use Amazon Athena.

B. To create the keys, use Amazon S3 and the custom key stores with the CloudHSM cluster. For auditing, use
AWS CloudTrail.

C. To create the keys, use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) and the custom key stores with the
CloudHSM cluster. For auditing, use Amazon GuardDuty.

D. To create the keys, use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) and the custom key stores with the
CloudHSM cluster. For auditing, use AWS CloudTrail.

Answer: D
