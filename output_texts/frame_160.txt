79. The Security Engineer has discovered that a new application that deals with highly sensitive data is
storing Amazon $3 objects with the following key pattern, which itself contains highly sensitive data.

Pattern:

"randomlD_datestamp_PIl.csv"

Example:

"1234567_12302017_000-00-0000 csv"

The bucket where these objects are being stored is using server-side encryption (SSE).
Which solution is the most secure and cost-effective option to protect the sensitive data?

A. Remove the sensitive data from the object name, and store the sensitive data using $3 user-defined
metadata.

B. Add an $3 bucket policy that denies the action s3:GetObject

C. Use a random and unique S3 object key, and create an S3 metadata index in Amazon DynamoDB
using client-side encrypted attributes.

D. Store all sensitive objects in Binary Large Objects (BLOBS) in an encrypted Amazon RDS instance.

Answer: C
