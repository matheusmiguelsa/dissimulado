81. A Security Engineer must design a system that can detect whether a file on an Amazon EC2 host
has been modified. The system must then alert the Security

Engineer of the modification.
What is the MOST efficient way to meet these requirements?

A. Install antivirus software and ensure that signatures are up-to-date. Configure Amazon CloudWatch
alarms to send alerts for security events.

B. Install host-based IDS software to check for file integrity. Export the logs to Amazon CloudWatch
Logs for monitoring and alerting.

C. Export system log files to Amazon S3. Parse the log files using an AWS Lambda function that will
send alerts of any unauthorized system login attempts through Amazon SNS.

D. Use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to detect file system changes. If a change is detected, automatically
terminate and recreate the instance from the most recent AMI. Use Amazon SNS to send notification of
the event.
