131. A company has decided to migrate sensitive documents from on-premises data centers to
Amazon S3. Currently, the hard drives are encrypted to meet a compliance requirement regarding data
encryption. The CISO wants to improve security by encrypting each file using a different key instead of
a single key. Using a different key would limit the security impact of a single exposed key.

Which of the following requires the LEAST amount of configuration when implementing this approach?

A. Place each file into a different $3 bucket. Set the default encryption of each bucket to use a
different AWS KMS customer managed key.

B. Put all the files in the same S3 bucket. Using $3 events as a trigger, write an AWS Lambda function
to encrypt each file as it is added using different AWS KMS data keys.

C. Use the $3 encryption client to encrypt each file individually using S3-generated data keys.

D. Place all the files in the same S3 bucket. Use server-side encryption with AWS KMS-managed keys
(SSE-KMS) to encrypt the data.

Answer: D
