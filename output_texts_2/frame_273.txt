355) A company's security engineer wants to receive an email alert whenever Amazon GuardDuty, AWS Identity and Access
Management Access Analyzer, or Amazon Made generate a high-severity security finding. The company uses AWS Control Tower
to govern all of its accounts. The company also uses AWS Security Hub with all of the AWS service integrations turned on.

Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

A.Set up separate AWS Lambda functions for GuardDuty, 1AM Access Analyzer, and Macie to call each service's public API
to retrieve high-severity findings. Use Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to send the email alerts. Create an
Amazon EventBridge rule to invoke the functions on a schedule.

B.Create an Amazon EventBridge rule with a pattern that matches Security Hub findings events with high severity. Configure
the rule to send the findings to a target Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. Subscribe the desired
email addresses to the SNS topic.

C.Create an Amazon EventBridge rule with a pattern that matches AWS Control Tower events with high severity. Configure
the rule to send the findings to a target Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. Subscribe the desired
email addresses to the SNS topic.

D.Host an application on Amazon EC2 to call the GuardDuty, 1AM Access Analyzer, and Macie APIs.

Within the application, use the Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) API to retrieve high-severity findings and
to send the findings to an SNS topic. Subscribe the desired email addresses to the SNS topic.
