368) A company hosts business-critical applications on Amazon EC2 instances in a VPC. The VPC uses default DHCP
options sets. A security engineer needs to log all DNS queries that internal resources make in the VPC. The security
engineer also must create a list of the most common DNS queries over time.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Install the Amazon CloudWatch agent on each EC2 instance in the VPC. Use the CloudWatch agent
to stream the DNS query logs to an Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group. Use CloudWatch metric
filters to automatically generate metrics that list the most common ONS queries.

B. Create VPC flow logs for all subnets in the VPC. Stream the flow logs to an Amazon CloudWatch
Logs log group. Use CloudWatch Logs Insights to list the most common DNS queries for the log
group in a custom dashboard.

C. Install a BIND DNS server in the VPC. Create a bash script to list the DNS request number of
common DNS queries from the BIND logs.

D. Configure Amazon Route 53 Resolver query logging. Add an Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group
as the destination. Use Amazon CloudWatch Contributor Insights to analyze the data and create time
series that display the most common DNS queries.

Correct Answer: D
