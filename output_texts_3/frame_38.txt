A Security Engineer sent a ping command from her laptop, with an IP address of 112.237.99.166, to an EC2 instance which has a private IP address of 172.31.17.140. However, the response ping is dropped and does not reach her laptop. To troubleshoot the issue, the Engineer checked the flow logs of your VPC and saw the following entries as shown below.

2 123456789010 eni-1235b8ca 112.237.99.166 172.31.17.140 0 0 1 4 336 1432917027 1432917142
ACCEPT OK
