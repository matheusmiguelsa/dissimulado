200. A company uses multiple AWS accounts managed with AWS Organizations. Security engineers have
created a standard set of security groups for all these. accounts. The security policy requires that these
security groups be used for all applications and delegates modification authority to the security team only.

A recent security audit found that the security groups are inconsistently implemented across accounts and

that unauthorized changes have been made to the security groups. A security engineer needs to recommend

a solution to improve consistency and to prevent unauthorized changes in the individual accounts in the
uture.

Which solution should the security engineer recommend?

A. Use AWS Resource Access Manager to create shared resources for each required security group and
apply an IAM policy that permits read-only access to the security groups only.

B. Create an AWS CloudFormation template that creates the required security groups. Execute the template
as part of configuring new accounts. Enable Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)
notifications when changes occur.

C. Use AWS Firewall Manager to create a security group policy, enable the policy feature to identify and
revert local changes, and enable automatic remediation.

D. Use AWS Control Tower to edit the account factory template to enable the share security groups option.
Apply an SCP to the OU or individual accounts that prohibits security group modifications from local account
users.
