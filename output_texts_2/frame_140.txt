295) A company has implemented IAM WAF and Amazon CloudFront for an application. The application runs on Amazon EC2
instances that are part of an Auto Scaling group. The Auto Scaling group is behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB).

The [AM WAF web ACL uses an IAM Managed Rules rule group and is associated with the CloudFront distribution. CloudFront
receives the request from IAM WAF and then uses the ALB as the distributionâ€™s origin.

During a security review, a security engineer discovers that the infrastructure is susceptible to a large, layer 7 DDoS attack.
How can the security engineer improve the security at the edge of the solution to defend against this type of attack?

A.Configure the CloudFront distribution to use the Lambda@Edge feature. Create an IAM Lambda function that
imposes a rate limit on CloudFront viewer requests. Block the request if the rate limit is exceeded.
B.Configure the |AM WAF web ACL so that the web ACL has more capacity units to process all IAM WAF rules faster.
C.Configure IAM WAF with a rate-based rule that imposes a rate limit that automatically blocks requests when the
rate limit is exceeded.
D.Configure the CloudFront distribution to use IAM WAF as its origin instead of the ALB.
Answer: C
