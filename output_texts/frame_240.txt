118. A company has a few dozen application servers in private subnets behind an Elastic Load
Balancer (ELB) in an AWS Auto Scaling group. The application is accessed from the web over HTTPS.
The data must always be encrypted in transit. The Security Engineer is worried about potential key
exposure due to vulnerabilities in the application software.

Which approach will meet these requirements while protecting the external certificate during a breach?

A. Use a Network Load Balancer (NLB) to pass through traffic on port 443 from the internet to port 443
on the instances.

B. Purchase an external certificate, and upload it to the AWS Certificate Manager (for use with the ELB)
and to the instances. Have the ELB decrypt traffic, and route and re-encrypt with the same certificate.

C. Generate an internal self-signed certificate and apply it to the instances. Use AWS Certificate
Manager to generate a new external certificate for the ELB. Have the ELB decrypt traffic, and route and
re-encrypt with the internal certificate.

D. Upload a new external certificate to the load balancer. Have the ELB decrypt the traffic and forward
it on port 80 to the instances

Answer: C
