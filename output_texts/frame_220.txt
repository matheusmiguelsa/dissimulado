108. The Accounting department at Example Corp. has made a decision to hire a third-party firm,
AnyCompany, to monitor Example Corp.'s AWS account to help optimize costs.

The Security Engineer for Example Corp. has been tasked with providing AnyCompany with access to the
required Example Corp. AWS resources. The Engineer has created an IAM role and granted permission to
AnyCompany's AWS account to assume this role.

that one of AnyCompany's other customers might deduce Example Corp.'s role ARN and potentially
compromise the company's account.

A. Create an IAM user and generate a set of long-term credentials. Provide the credentials to AnyCompany.
Monitor access in IAM access advisor and plan to rotate credentials on a recurring basis.

C. Require two-factor authentication by adding a condition to the role's trust policy with
aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent.
