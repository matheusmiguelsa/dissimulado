292) A company's engineering team is developing a new application that creates IAM Key Management Service (IAM KMS)
CMK grants for users immediately after a grant IS created users must be able to use the CMK tu encrypt a 512-byte payload.

During load testing, a bug appears |intermittently where AccessDeniedExceptions are occasionally triggered when a user first
attempts to encrypt using the CMK

Which solution should the cOmpany’s security specialist recommend’?

A.Instruct users to implement a retry mechanism every 2 minutes until the call succeeds.

B.Instruct the engineering team to consume a random grant token from users, and to call the CreateGrant
operation, passing it the grant token. Instruct use to use that grant token in their call to encrypt.

C.Instruct the engineering team to create a random name for the grant when calling the CreateGrant operation.
Return the name to the users and instruct them to provide the name as the grant token in the call to encrypt.
D.Instruct the engineering team to pass the grant token returned in the CreateGrant response to users. Instruct
users to use that grant token in their call to encrypt.

Answer: D
