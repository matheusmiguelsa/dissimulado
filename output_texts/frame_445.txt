220. A company is implementing a new application in a new AWS account. A VPC and subnets have been created for the
application. The application has been peered to an existing VPC in another account in the same AWS Region for database
access. Amazon EC? instances will regularly be created and terminated in the application VPC, but only some of them will
need access to the databases in the peeredâ€™ VPC over TCP port 1521. A security engineer must ensure that only the

EC2 instances than need access to the databases can access them through the network.
How can the security engineer implement this solution?

A. Create a new security group in the database VPC and create an inbound rule that allows all traffic from the IP address
range of the application PG. Add a new network ACL rule on the database subnets. Configure the rule to TCP port 1521
from the IP address range of the application VPC. Attach the new security group to the database instances that the
application instances need to access.

B. Create a new security group in the application VPC with an inbound rule that allows the IP address range of the
database VPC over TCP port 1521. Create a new security group in the database VPC with an inbound rule that allows the
IP address range of the application VPC over port 1521. Attach the new security group to the database instances and the
application instances that need database access.

C. Create anew security group in thea plication VPC with no inbound rules. Create a new security group in the database
VPC with an inbound rule that allows TCP port 1521 from the new application security group in the application VPC.
Attach the application security group to the application instances that need database access, and at

security group to the database instances.

D. Create a new security group in the application VPC with an inbound rule that allows the IP address range of the
database VPC over TCP port 1521. Add a new network ACL rule on the database subnets. Configure the rule to allow all
traffic from the IP address range of the application VPC. Attach the new security group to the application instances that
need database access.
