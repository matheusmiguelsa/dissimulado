410) A company is developing an ecommerce application. The application uses Amazon EC2 instances and an Amazon
RDS MySQL database. For compliance reasons, data must be secured in transit and at rest. The company needs a
solution that minimizes operational overhead and minimizes cost.

Which solution meets these requirements?

A. Use TLS certificates from AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) with an Application Load Balancer. Deploy self-signed
certificates on the EC2 instances. Ensure that the database client software uses a TLS connection to Amazon RDS.
Enable encryption of the RDS DB instance. Enable encryption on the Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)
volumes that support the EC2 instances.

B. Use TLS certificates from a third-party vendor with an Application Load Balancer. Install the same certificates on
the EC2 instances. Ensure that the database client software uses a TLS connection to Amazon RDS. Use AWS Secrets
Manager for client-side encryption of application data.

C. Use AWS CloudHSM to generate TLS certificates for the EC2 instances. Install the TLS certificates on the EC2
instances. Ensure that the database client software uses a TLS connection to Amazon RDS. Use the encryption keys
form CloudHSM for client-side encryption of application data.

D. Use Amazon CloudFront with AWS WAF. Send HTTP connections to the origin EC2 instances. Ensure that the
database client software uses a TLS connection to Amazon RDS. Use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) for
client-side encryption of application data before the data is stored in the RDS database.
