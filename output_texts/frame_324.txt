160. A company's Security Engineer has been tasked with restricting a contractor's IAM account
access to the company's Amazon EC2 console without providing access to any other AWS services.
The contractor's [AM account must not be able to gain access to any other AWS service, even if the
IAM account is assigned additional permissions based on [AM group membership.

What should the Security Engineer do to meet these requirements?
A. Create an Inline IAM user policy that allows for Amazon EC2 access for the contractor's IAM user.

B. Create an IAM permissions boundary policy that allows Amazon EC2 access. Associate the
contractor's IAM account with the IAM permissions boundary policy.

C. Create an IAM group with an attached policy that allows for Amazon EC2 access. Associate the
contractor's IAM account with the IAM group.

D. Create an IAM role that allows for EC2 and explicitly denies all other services. Instruct the contractor
to always assume this role.

Answer: B
