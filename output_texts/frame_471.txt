233. A large government organization is moving to the cloud and has specific encryption requirements.
The first workload to move requires that a customer's data be immediately destroyed when the
customer makes that request.

Management has asked the security team to provide a solution that will securely store the data, allow
only authorized applications to perform encryption and decryption, and allow for immediate destruction
of the data.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Use AWS Secrets Manager and an AWS SDK to create a unique secret for the customer-specific
data.

B. Use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) and the AWS Encryption SDK to generate and store a
data encryption key for each customer.

C. Use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) with service-managed keys to generate and store
customer-specific data encryption keys.

D. Use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) and create an AWS CloudHSM custom key store. Use
CloudHSM to generate and store a new CMK for each customer.

Answer: D
