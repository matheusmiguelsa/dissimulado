Lambda function to rotate database credentials. Set up TLS for the connection to the database.
B.Install a database on an Amazon EC2 Instance. Enable third-party disk encryption to encrypt the Amazon Elastic Block
Store (Amazon EBS) volume. Store the database credentials in IAM CloudHSM with automatic rotation. Set up TLS for the
connection to the database.
C.Enable Amazon RDS encryption to encrypt the database and snapshots. Enable Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon
EBS) encryption on Amazon EC2 instances. Store the database credentials in IAM Secrets Manager with automatic
rotation. Set up TLS for the connection to the RDS hosted database.
D.Set up an IAM CloudHSM cluster with IAM Key Management Service (IAM KMS) to store KMS keys.
